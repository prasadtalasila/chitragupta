"""Near-duplicate citekey detection: flags likely repeat imports of the
same paper under two different citekeys -- a common Zotero failure mode
(the same item added twice, once per re-export, or once per each of two
overlapping search hits).

Advisory only, exactly like sync.py's existing no-author-metadata
warning -- this never blocks a sync or removes anything. A human still
decides whether two flagged entries are really the same source: a shared
DOI is essentially certain, but a shared title is only a heuristic --
this project's own real bibliography has a `kayla_digital_2023` /
`digital_twin_consortium_digital_2023` pair with an identical title
("Digital Twin Platform Stack Architectural Framework by Digital Twin
Consortium") that turn out to be a blog post and a webinar recording
about the same named report, not the same citable source. This checker
cannot tell that apart from a genuine duplicate and doesn't try to --
it surfaces the pair and leaves the call to the person re-exporting the
bib file.
