"""One writer at a time across content/.

`sync` and `chitragupta/enrich/__main__.py` both write there, and the planned
cron job makes overlap a matter of time rather than bad luck. Two runs
overlapping is not merely wasteful: sync's parsed-text writes are not
atomic, so a concurrent enrichment run can read a half-written
content/parsed/<citekey>.txt, and both can contend for the same GPUs.

The mutex is a dedicated sqlite file, held under `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` by its
own connection. That choice was made from measurement, not taste --
against real sqlite, before any of this was written:

  - a connection holding BEGIN IMMEDIATE does **not** block other
    processes from reading, because it takes a RESERVED lock rather than
    an EXCLUSIVE one. `citation_gate`, `retrieval` and the drafting
    skills keep working while a sync runs. (This was the objection that
    nearly ruled the design out; it turned out to be false.)
  - a second process attempting BEGIN IMMEDIATE gets SQLITE_BUSY, so it
    is a real mutex.
  - after `kill -9` on the holder, the lock is released **immediately**.
    That is the property that decides this design: staleness handles
    itself, with no PID liveness check and no platform-specific code for
    the CI leg nobody watches.
  - a bare BEGIN IMMEDIATE with no write still holds it, so the lock
    connection never has to dirty anything.

Two alternatives, and why not:

  - An `os.open(O_CREAT|O_EXCL)` lock file needs stale-lock detection,
    which means `os.kill(pid, 0)` on POSIX and something else on Windows
    -- exactly the kind of branch that rots on the untested platform.
  - Locking `content/ledger.sqlite` itself would force the whole run into
    one transaction. `chitragupta/ledger.py` commits at five separate points, so
    that would trade incremental durability for the mutex: a crash at 90%
    would discard every parse recorded up to then.

Portability note: this inherits sqlite's own locking, which is
unreliable on network filesystems. That is not a new constraint -- the
ledger already depends on it -- so `content/` must live on a local
filesystem either way.

Scope: this serialises *writers*. Readers are deliberately unaffected,
which is the point of the separate file.
