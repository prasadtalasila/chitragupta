"""Stage 3: sentence-transformers embeddings persisted in a Chroma collection.

This is the real embedding-based retrieval the corpus layer's
chitragupta/retrieval.py deliberately deferred (keyword overlap only, pending a
larger corpus). Needs `sentence-transformers` and `chromadb` from
pyproject.toml's "enrich" Poetry group, in a venv.

build_index() is incremental, mirroring the corpus layer's
chitragupta/ledger.py: skip reprocessing whatever hasn't detectably changed
since the last run. Here that means each chunk's stored
metadata carries a hash of the *text that produced it* (not the PDF
bytes -- Docling reprocessing the same PDF, or a manually edited parsed
.txt, can change the embedded text without the PDF itself changing), and
a doc whose current text hashes the same as what's already indexed skips
model.encode() entirely. Only genuinely new/changed docs pay the encode
cost. This also fixes a latent bug: previously, a doc whose chunk count
*shrank* between runs left its old, now-orphaned trailing chunks in
Chroma forever (upsert only ever adds/overwrites, never removes) -- an
unchanged-vs-changed check that deletes-then-reinserts on a real change
closes that gap too.

    Different models produce different-dimensioned vectors (e.g.

    off the text hash -- silently keep serving stale vectors from the old
    model for any doc whose text hasn't changed. Namespacing the collection

    starts a fresh, empty collection instead of corrupting or stale-skipping
