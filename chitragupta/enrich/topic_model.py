"""Stage 4: BERTopic clustering over the corpus.

Needs `bertopic` from pyproject.toml's "enrich" Poetry group, in a venv. With a
handful of documents, HDBSCAN's default min_cluster_size (10) will
legitimately put everything in the outlier topic (-1) -- that is the
correct output for a small corpus, not a bug. Don't lower
min_cluster_size to force clusters into existence; report the outlier
result honestly and let the topic model become meaningful once the
corpus is large enough to justify it.

Unlike every other stage, this one has no downstream consumer in the
repository: nothing imports it, and no genre skill reads
config.TOPICS_PATH. `survey-writer` groups its themes by judgement over
the evidence it retrieved and says so ("With a small corpus there's no
BERTopic step"). The output is written for a human deciding what a survey
should cover. Wiring it in is a real option -- DEVELOPER.md's
"`content/topics.json` has no consumer" records what that would take and
why it hasn't been done -- but until then, don't assume a caller
somewhere depends on this file's shape.

It is also the one stage that can't be incremental, which is the reason
that matters here: clustering is whole-corpus, so one added document can
move every assignment, and topic ids are not stable between runs.

BERTopic's clustering step is inherently whole-corpus -- adding one new
document can shift every cluster assignment, so unlike
embed_index.build_index() there's no "skip this doc" option for the
clustering itself. What *is* skippable is the expensive part before it:
re-embedding a document's full text with model.encode(). This module
caches one whole-text embedding per citekey (config.TOPIC_EMBED_CACHE_PATH,
keyed by the same hash_text() embed_index.py uses for its own per-chunk
cache) and only calls encode() for docs whose text hash changed since the
last run, batching all of them into one encode() call rather than one per
doc. Note this cache is intentionally separate from embed_index.py's
Chroma collection: that one stores per-*chunk* embeddings for retrieval,
this one stores one whole-document embedding per doc for clustering --
different granularity, not reusable as-is between the two.
