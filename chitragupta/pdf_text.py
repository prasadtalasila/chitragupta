"""PDF text extraction: dispatches to whichever backend config.PARSER
names (config.toml's [parser].backend, or the PARSER env var) --
"pdftotext" (default) or "docling". Both write into
the same place, content/parsed/<citekey>.txt, so every downstream
consumer (chitragupta/ledger.py, chitragupta/retrieval.py, chitragupta/review/verbatim_check.py)
stays backend-agnostic; only this module needs to know which one is
configured.

pdftotext has no Python dependency (a subprocess call to poppler-utils).
Its output has native page boundaries (form-feed characters between
pages); docling's does not by default, but _extract_docling below asks
for the same `\f` markers explicitly, so both backends' output in
content/parsed/ has the same shape -- see that function's docstring for
the one way the two aren't quite identical. See config.toml's [parser]
comment for the full tradeoffs (speed, OCR cost) before switching off
the default.

The dispatch is deliberately a table rather than an if/else: adding a
backend is a `_extract_*` function plus one `_EXTRACTORS` entry, and
markitdown was removed through the same seam (see docs/PDF-PARSER.md for why).

# about 4x.

# **A full-corpus sweep does not support it.** Measured over all 501 PDFs

#   - docling's own num_threads changes a run by 1.9% -- noise -- so a
#     worker is not doing four CPUs of parallel work.
# Past ~32 workers the curve plateaus rather than reversing (32 and 48
# land within 0.9% over three runs each), so the finding is "this divisor
# is much too large", not "it should be 1.5".

    gets on with something else.

    This is where the saving actually comes from, and it is worth being
    precise about why. Workers import torch and docling *concurrently*,
    so on a host with CPUs to spare their import cost is already
    overlapped -- measured, forkserver's preload against spawn's
    per-worker imports is a wash (22.4s against 22.9s over 8 documents at
    4 workers). What is not overlapped is the preload itself: it happens
    when the pool is built, with the parent blocked on it. Started here
    instead, it runs during the ~2.5s the parent spends reading a
    646-entry bibliography, and the pool is ready 2.5s sooner (4.4s
    against 6.9s from process start to four live workers).

    `ensure_running()` returns in ~0.02s -- it launches the server and
    does not wait for its imports -- so this costs the caller nothing to
    call. It is not public API; the alternative is creating a throwaway
    Process purely for its side effect, which is worse.

    Deliberately silent about every reason it might decline: this is an
    optimisation, and a caller that gets a slower pool than it could have
    is not a caller with a problem to report.

    Declines in three cases, because starting a torch-importing process
    for a run that will not use one is pure cost:

    - not the docling backend (pdftotext gets threads, and has no use for
      torch at all);
    - [parser].workers left at its default of 1, i.e. the serial path;
    - this machine's ceiling is 1 regardless of what was asked for, which
      is `workers = "auto"` on anything up to four available CPUs. That
      case is the reason worker_ceiling() exists separately: without it,
      "auto" on a four-core laptop would launch a forkserver and import
      torch on every sync, then run serially anyway.

    What it still cannot know is how many documents need parsing -- that
    needs the bibliography this call is meant to overlap with. So a run
    with nothing to do has paid for a forkserver. That is the one case
    left, it costs a background import rather than any wall clock the
    user waits on, and closing it would mean giving up the overlap that
    is the entire point.

    `typing/` package. On this process it usually loses the race against
    the standard library, so nothing is visibly wrong. In a **spawned
    worker** it does not: spawn rebuilds sys.path from the parent's, the
    cv2 entry can land ahead of the stdlib, and `import typing` then
    resolves to `cv2.typing`, which imports `cv2.dnn`, which needs

    `result.document` carries per-item page numbers, bounding boxes and

    docs/CITATION-PROVENANCE.md. `export_to_markdown()` keeps the reading
    order and drops the rest. One plain-text file per citekey is still the
    right shape for what the corpus layer owes its callers -- BM25 ranks
    text, not boxes -- so the structure leaves by a second door instead:
    the returned records become `content/parsed/<citekey>.passages.json`,
    rung 2 of `chitragupta/passages.py`'s ladder, and the caller (`extract_text`)
    writes them.

    Two things make that work, and both are one keyword each:

    `page_break_placeholder="\\f"` puts form feeds where the pages were, so
    this backend's output has the same shape as `pdftotext`'s and every
    consumer that splits on them -- the passage ladder's page-level rung,
    `chitragupta/review/verbatim_check.py` -- reports a real page instead of p.1.
    Docling emits a break *between* consecutive pages that carry items and
    none before the first, so splitting yields 1-based page numbers
    directly. A page carrying no items at all contributes no break and so
    shifts the pages after it; the sidecar is unaffected, because it
    records each item's own `page_no` rather than counting separators.
    `\\f` is whitespace, so BM25 tokenisation and `run_together_ratio` see
    exactly what they saw before.

    chitragupta/enrich/docling_parse.py is the other consumer of this library, and

    `sys.stderr` once -- when its handler or its `tqdm` is built -- and

    Line-oriented rather than write-oriented. A backend building one line
    out of several writes (`print(..., end="")`) must not have the
    citekey striped through the middle of it, so the wrapper remembers
    whether the last thing it wrote ended a line and prefixes only when
    the next one starts one. `\\r` counts as ending a line: a progress
    bar redrawing in place is starting the line again, and wants the

    Everything else is delegated. Docling asks its stream whether it is a

    neither names a document. Interleaved with `sync`'s own progress

    `[n/N] <citekey>` *before* the slow call, and above one worker there
    are several documents in flight at once, so a complaint sits under

    and so does the `StreamHandler` a logging library installs. Doing it
    twice -- a `logging` record factory *and* the stream -- was tried
    first and prints the citekey twice on every logged line, because the
