"""Builds a "## References" section for a genre draft's Markdown source,
sourced only from `content/ledger.sqlite` (populated by `sync` from
`bibliography.bib`, the source of truth). Stdlib-only (`sqlite3`, `json`),
like `citation_gate.py`, so it runs with bare `python` -- no
`bibtexparser`/venv needed. Deliberately doesn't read `bibliography.bib`
itself; `chitragupta/bib_reader.py` is the only module that does (AGENTS.md), which
is why the fields an entry needs beyond title/year (authors, venue, volume,
pages, publisher) travel through the ledger's `bib_fields` column rather
than being re-read from the bib file here.

Only ever lists citekeys the draft already cites (found with
`citation_gate`'s own extraction regexes), so it can never introduce a
citekey that hasn't already passed the gate. Run this *after*
`python -m chitragupta.draft gate` has reported `OK`. A cited key with no
matching ledger row is a hard error (AGENTS.md's citekey invariant), not
something to silently drop.

Entries are numbered IEEE-style ("[1] J. Doe and R. Roe, "Title," IEEE
Trans. Testing, vol. 1, pp. 1-10, 2021.") and ordered by first appearance
in the draft, which is the order pandoc's own citeproc numbers citations
in -- so this list and the rendered PDF's bibliography agree on which
source is [1]. Each entry keeps its citekey in a trailing code span:
inline citations in the draft source are still `[@citekey]`, so the key is
what makes an entry traceable from the text, and a code span is invisible
to `citation_gate` (it blanks code spans before scanning), so listing a
key here can never look like citing it.

For a reader who wants numbers inline as well, `numbered_markdown` (used
by `render_output --format md`) returns a *derived* copy with every
`[@citekey]` replaced by its number. That copy is never the draft: the
draft's literal citekeys are what `citation_gate` verifies and what
pandoc resolves, and a numbered body would leave the gate reporting
"0 citations ... OK" on a draft it can no longer check at all.

Usage:
    python -m chitragupta.draft references <file.md> [--heading TEXT]
Appends a References section, or replaces one if this was already run on
the file (idempotent) -- built from exactly the citekeys `<file.md>`
cites.
