# Developer guide

Material for working on this repository itself, as opposed to using it to
draft content -- test running, the full source layout, and known gaps.
See [README.md](README.md) for the user-facing Quickstart/Configuration/
Architecture docs and [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) for the container build.

## Running tests

```bash
# Install pytest/pytest-cov into the same venv (run python-deps first)
bash scripts/install_full_pipeline.sh dev-deps

# Run the full suite with coverage
.venv-full/bin/python -m pytest --cov=src --cov=scripts --cov-report=term-missing

# Same, on a host without pandoc/TeX Live/poppler: the render tests skip,
# so opt out of the 100% bar (pyproject's fail_under) rather than lower it
.venv-full/bin/python -m pytest --cov=src --cov=scripts --cov-report=term-missing \
    --cov-fail-under=0
```

`tests/` covers both the corpus layer and `src/enrich/*` -- the enrich group's
dependencies (docling, chromadb, bertopic,
sentence-transformers) are mocked via `sys.modules` for fast,
deterministic unit tests, so the
`dev-deps` group alone is *not* enough on its own: the `enrich` group
(`python-deps`, step 1 of Quickstart) must already be installed too, since
`tests/test_bib_reader.py` needs `bibtexparser` and the `src/enrich/` test
modules need docling/chromadb/bertopic/sentence-transformers. A handful of tests
(`tests/test_feature_workflows.py`, the `TestRenderReal`/`TestExtractTextReal`
classes elsewhere) run the real `pdftotext`/`pandoc`/`pdflatex` binaries
end to end rather than mocking them, and skip automatically if those
aren't on `PATH`.

## Benchmarking the parser

`bench/` measures what a full `docling` parse of the bib corpus costs on
a given machine, and is deliberately kept out of `tests/`: it takes a couple of
hours, needs real PDFs and a GPU, and answers a "how long / what's the
bottleneck" question rather than a pass/fail one. It is excluded from the
release zip for the same reason `tests/` is.

- [docs/PERFORMANCE.md](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) -- what each setting costs,
  organised by setting. Ships in the release archive, unlike `bench/`
- [docs/PARALLELISM.md](docs/PARALLELISM.md) -- parallel parse design:
  architecture, components, and the roadmap
- [bench/README.md](https://github.com/prasadtalasila/chitragupta/blob/main/bench/README.md) -- how to run it, and what each
  switch measures
- [bench/RESULTS.md](https://github.com/prasadtalasila/chitragupta/blob/main/bench/RESULTS.md) -- the dated measurement record,
  newest last, with raw per-run data in `bench/results/`. Read its
  "Which sections are current" table first: several early conclusions
  were overturned by later runs and are kept, marked, rather than deleted
- [bench/PARALLELISM-PLAN.md](https://github.com/prasadtalasila/chitragupta/blob/main/bench/PARALLELISM-PLAN.md) -- what is still
  unknown, and what to measure before changing it

The headline, in the order it was found:

1. Parsing all 501 bib PDFs with `docling` took ~1.6 hours (later
   measured at 1h 56m), with the A40 at ~7% utilization and three CPU
   cores of 48 busy. The GPU was worth only 1.79x over CPU-only -- the
   work was CPU-bound.
2. Turning OCR off (v0.12.0) was worth more than the GPU: **2.08x
   serially, 3.91x at 12 workers and 4.79x at 24**, since OCR competes
   for the same CPU the parallelism needs. (An earlier 2.46x, from a
   16-PDF serial sample, is still quoted in older text; it estimated the
   serial case only.)
3. Parallelising `sync` (v1.0.0) was worth 3.60x at four workers.
4. That moved the bottleneck onto a single GPU: `AcceleratorDevice.AUTO`
   resolves to `cuda:0` in every worker, so GPU 0 ran at 100% while
   GPUs 1-3 idled.
5. Giving each worker its own card (v1.1.0) was worth a further **1.62x**
   on the full corpus -- 528s to 326s at twelve workers. The whole
   501-PDF corpus now parses in **5m 10s**, against 1h 56m where this
   started.
6. Per-worker startup (v2.1.0) turned out to be 3.2s of importing torch
   and docling plus ~5s of loading Docling's models, and only the first
   is shareable between processes. A forkserver pool with those modules
   preloaded, started before the bibliography is read, takes a fixed
   ~1.5-2s off pool startup -- 9.6% of an 8-document run, 2.5% of a
   60-document one.
7. Measuring the **whole** corpus instead of extrapolating from a 16-PDF
   sample (2026-08-04) found the serial baseline was 55m 30s, not the
   ~39m every document had quoted -- **41% low**. Correcting it showed
   12-worker efficiency is 89%, not the 60% previously reported, and that
   `worker_ceiling()`'s `cpus // 4` clamp costs **1.41x**: 32 workers
   beat the 12 it allows.
8. Asking whether a *quotable passage* survives a re-parse (2026-08-07,
   `bench/repro_check.py`) found that ~1% of documents come back with a
   different passage text, and -- correcting what this project had
   asserted twice -- that two runs of the **same** configuration are not
   exempt either. The artifact-by-artifact contract that came out of it
   is in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#what-is-reproducible-and-what-is-not).

The lesson worth carrying: every one of those steps was measured, and
seven intermediate conclusions were wrong until the next measurement
corrected them -- including two that sat in the code as stated fact, and
one that had been written into three documents. `bench/` exists so that
the next one is checked too.

## Writing a script that drives the enrichment layer

`src.enrich.docling_parse.parse_corpus` and `python -m src.sync` both use
a worker pool when `[parser].workers` is above 1, and every start method
they can pick (`forkserver` or `spawn` -- see `[parser].start_method`)
re-imports the calling program's `__main__` in each worker. Any script of
your own that calls them must guard its top level:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Without it, every worker re-runs the script on startup and the pool dies
with `BrokenProcessPool`. `src/enrich/__main__.py` and `src/sync.py`
are both guarded already; this only bites ad-hoc scripts, and it bites
immediately rather than subtly.

                          `Status: **<kind>.** Written <date>.`, so a reader can tell what they are

                            reference.               what exists and how to look it up
                            how-to.                  a procedure to follow start to finish
                            implemented.             a built subsystem, described as built

                          is when it was written, not when it was last touched -- git already

                          on purpose: the site is this repository as it stands, so every cross-document

                          .github/workflows/docs.yml from pyproject.toml's optional `docs` group
                          (`poetry install --only docs`). Read its header before editing
src/                      the corpus and drafting layers (sync needs bibtexparser;
                          citation_gate/references need nothing)
  config.py                 loads config.toml, env var overrides
  runlock.py                one-writer-at-a-time lock over content/, held by both entrypoints;
                          a dedicated sqlite file, so a killed holder releases it with no
                          staleness check and readers are never blocked
  bib_reader.py             parses bibliography.bib -- the only citekey source
  ledger.py                 per-citekey status tracking (content/ledger.sqlite); find_stale/prune_missing
                          detect/remove rows for citekeys no longer in the bib file. Also persists each
                          entry's formatting-relevant BibTeX fields (bib_fields, JSON), so references.py
                          can build a full bibliography entry without reading the bib file itself
  pdf_text.py               PDF text extraction, dispatched to pdftotext/docling by config.PARSER; also the parse-quality guard
  sync.py                   orchestrates the above -- the corpus-layer entrypoint; --remove-stale opts into
                          deleting stale ledger rows (default: report only, see README's "Removing a paper")
  dedup.py                  advisory near-duplicate citekey detection (shared DOI/title), called from sync
  retrieval.py              BM25 search over the corpus layer, backed by a cached term-frequency index.
                          `search` ranks and returns a snippet -- the best-covering passage for the
                          query, and the same one every run; `evidence` reads more of one document
                          when a snippet is not enough to judge it. A lookup, not a stage: see
                          docs/REJECTION.md for the two-stage read that was built and withdrawn.
                          `--log` records each call's payload in the dossier
  passages.py               where a citekey's supporting text comes from (docling sidecar -> form-feed
                          pages -> pdftotext) and whether it may be quoted -- shared by the consumers
                          that need to point at part of a source rather than all of it
  overlap_index.py          disk-cached word n-gram fingerprint index (content/overlap/) for
                          src/review/verbatim_check.py's overlap and scan modes -- one .fpr file per citekey plus
                          a merged, binary-searchable corpus-wide index.bin, both keyed by
                          (pdf_hash, parsed-file stat) so a re-run over an unchanged corpus costs no
                          re-fingerprinting. Read-only over the corpus layer, no writer lock
  citation_gate.py          hard citation-verification gate -- the drafting layer must pass this
  dossier.py                the working state behind a draft (reader, scope, kept evidence, rejected
                          candidates, steering, revision log) as Markdown under content/dossiers/,
                          mirroring the draft's path; plus tar.gz backup/restore. Read-only over the
                          corpus layer, never a gate -- see docs/DRAFT-ITERATION.md
  review.py                 the review layer's shared output contract -- report path (content/review/,
                          mirroring the draft), the "not a gate" banner, the header, and the
                          write-md-then-render routine all three commands use. No timestamp, so a
                          report diffs across revisions
  citation_coverage.py      review layer: retrieval-candidates-vs-actually-cited report, not a gate
  citation_provenance.py    review layer: what in each cited source supports the claim citing it, not a gate
                            (scores claims against passages.py's ladder; see docs/CITATION-PROVENANCE.md)
  references.py             auto-generates a draft's "## References" section from its own cited citekeys,
                          as numbered IEEE entries ordered by first appearance -- the same order (and
                          so the same numbers) pandoc's citeproc assigns when the draft is rendered
  render_output.py          Pandoc/TeX Live rendering + standalone CLI -- stdlib-only, no enrich group
                          needed, which is why it sits here and not in src/enrich/. `--format md` on a
                          Markdown draft skips pandoc entirely and emits references.numbered_markdown's
                          plain numbered copy instead
src/enrich/                the enrichment layer (pyproject.toml's "enrich" Poetry group), optional
  corpus.py                 the enrichment layer's view of the ledger -- one CorpusDoc per bib item,
                          so every enriched document is citable, keyed by its citekey
  docling_parse.py, embed_index.py, topic_model.py
scripts/
  install_full_pipeline.sh  single staged install path (os-deps/python-deps/dev-deps/all) for host + Docker
  enrich.py                 orchestrates src/enrich/* stages -- the enrichment layer's entry point
  verbatim_check.py          review layer: per-citekey overlap, whole-draft x whole-corpus scan, and
                          page-locating checks against sources

## Figures and copyright

With `[enrich].docling_images` on (off by default), the Docling stage writes
each paper's figure bitmaps to `content/docling/<doc>_artifacts/` and an
index of them to `content/docling/<doc>.figures.json`.

**Those images are a reading aid, not draft content.** Nothing in this
repo inserts them into `content/drafts/`, and nothing should start doing
so. A figure's copyright belongs to the publisher or the authors, and
citing a paper grants no right to reproduce its figures -- `citation_gate`
gates *citekeys*, and there is deliberately no equivalent gate for
images. The ledger also has no license column, so the pipeline genuinely
cannot tell a CC BY paper from an all-rights-reserved one; that judgment
stays with you, per figure.

The supported way to reference a figure is therefore **textually**, and
each record in `<doc>.figures.json` carries a ready-to-paste `cite`
string:

```json
{
  "page": 8,
  "caption": "Figure 3. Subdivision of the entry process of a Digital Twin",
  "cite": "Figure 3 of [@richstein_characterizing_2024], p.8",
  "image": "richstein_characterizing_2024_artifacts/image_000005_....png"
}
```

Two details worth knowing about that `cite` string:

- The number comes from the **caption's own text**, never from the
  picture's position. Publisher logos and licence badges are pictures
  too -- on a real 17-page MDPI paper, 6 of the 13 extracted pictures
  were furniture rather than figures -- so the Nth picture is routinely
  not the paper's Figure N.
- The number is captured *whole*, including chapter-scoped forms
  (`Fig. 1.1` ... `Fig. 1.4`, the convention in edited book chapters)
  and sub-figure letters (`Figure 2a`). Matching only the leading
  integer would collapse a chapter's four distinct figures onto one
  `Figure 1` -- a citation pointing at the wrong picture.
- A picture whose caption carries no number is cited by page instead
  (`"the figure on p.1 of [@key]"`), rather than being given a number
  this repo would have to invent. Two panels of one figure (captions
  beginning `(a)` / `(b)`) therefore share a page-based citation; that
  is the fallback behaving correctly, not a collision.

Every figure's `cite` string is a real `[@citekey]`, because every
document the enrichment layer parses comes from the bib file (see
`src/enrich/corpus.py`).

## Citation provenance

`python3 -m src.review provenance content/drafts/<slug>.md` reports, for
every citation in a draft, what in the cited source supports it and where
-- ordered worst match first. It writes
`content/review/<the draft's path minus its suffix>.provenance.md` plus
`.tex`/`.pdf` renders beside it. The report mirrors the draft's own place
under `content/drafts/`, the same rule `rendered/` and `dossiers/` follow
(`config.mirrored_dir`), and `src/review/__init__.py` owns that contract for all
three review-layer commands.

It was also an enrichment stage (`--stages provenance --input <draft>`)
until 4.0.0, which had the enrichment layer importing the review layer
and made this command wait on `sync`'s write lock. Run it directly.

**Advisory, not a gate**, deliberately: matching is lexical, so it
cannot tell "the source doesn't say this" from "the source says it in
words I didn't recognise". `citation_gate` blocks because it checks
something exact (ledger membership); this reports because it doesn't.

Passage quality depends on what has been parsed. With the Docling stage
run, `content/docling/<citekey>.passages.json` supplies reading-ordered
paragraphs and the report quotes them. Without it, `pdftotext` output is
used and the report gives a page number **without quoting** -- on a
two-column paper that text splices two columns onto every line, so any
excerpt would be a collage of two arguments.

Full design rationale, including the measurements behind those choices:
[docs/CITATION-PROVENANCE.md](docs/CITATION-PROVENANCE.md).

## Open questions and unbuilt features

Running this pipeline on a schedule was the long-standing goal here.
**Most of it now exists**, as of 3.4.0: a rotating log file (added as
`logs/sync.log`, and renamed to `logs/pipeline.log` once
`src/enrich/__main__.py` started sharing it -- see `src/logging_setup.py`),
a pages/s throughput figure, exit codes an unattended caller can branch
on, and worked cron and systemd units in
[docs/CLI.md](docs/CLI.md#running-sync-on-a-schedule) -- including the
absolute-interpreter-path detail that cron's minimal environment
requires.

**One blocker is left, and it is not a coding task.** With no continuous
auto-export, `bibliography.bib` is a manual, point-in-time snapshot: a
scheduled `sync` re-reads whatever was last exported, so it keeps the
corpus consistent with the bib file but cannot keep the bib file
consistent with your reference manager. A schedule watching only its
mtime does nothing until a human re-exports. Closing that properly means
either a Zotero auto-export plugin (outside this repo) or accepting that
the export stays a deliberate human step.

### `content/topics.json` has no consumer

`src/enrich/topic_model.py` writes it and nothing reads it -- no module, no
genre skill. `survey-writer` groups themes by judgement and says so
explicitly ("With a small corpus there's no BERTopic step"). That is
defensible today: clustering is whole-corpus, so assignments are not
stable between runs, and on a small corpus every document legitimately
lands in the outlier topic. If it is ever wired in, `survey-writer`'s
"Cluster by judgment" step is the seam, gated on the file existing and on
there being non-`-1` assignments -- the same shape the existing skills use
to gate on `content/chroma/`.
