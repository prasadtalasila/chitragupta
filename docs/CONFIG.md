# Configuration

Status: **reference.** Written 2026-08-03.

Every setting, what values it accepts, and what it defaults to.

What each setting *costs* lives in [PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md), so
this document can stay a reference rather than an argument.

## How configuration is loaded

`config.toml` is not in the repository -- you create it, once:

```bash
cp config.toml.example config.toml
```

`src/config.py` reads it at import time and **fails with that exact
command** if it is missing, rather than silently falling back to the
example: a machine quietly running settings its owner never chose is a
worse failure than one that refuses to start.

- The file is read **once, at import**, into plain module-level
  constants. They are fixed for the life of the process; editing
  `config.toml` mid-run changes nothing until the next run.
- Every setting can be overridden per-run by an **environment variable**
  of the same name, without editing the file:
  `BIB_FILE=/path/to/other.bib python -m src.sync`. The environment
  always wins.
- Set **`CONFIG_PATH`** to keep the file elsewhere:
  `CONFIG_PATH=/etc/research/config.toml python -m src.sync`.
- **Every key is optional.** Anything absent falls back to the default in
  the tables below, so your file only needs the settings you want to
  change.

`config.toml.example` is the tracked template, carrying the same settings
with longer commentary. This document is the authoritative list of
accepted values.

## A minimal config.toml

Because every key is optional, the smallest valid file is an **empty
file** -- that runs the whole pipeline on defaults, expecting your
bibliography at `papers/bibliography.bib`.

The smallest *useful* file names the one thing that genuinely varies
between machines:

```toml
# Minimal config.toml -- everything else falls back to its default.
[bib]
path = "papers/bibliography.bib"
```

A realistic small config, opting into the slower/higher-fidelity parser
and some parallelism:

```toml
[bib]
path = "papers/bibliography.bib"

[parser]
backend = "docling"   # "pdftotext" (default) or "docling"
workers = "auto"      # as many as this machine can sustain
```

## Every setting

Paths resolve **relative to the repository root**; an absolute path is
used as given.

### Paths

| Key | Env var | Accepts | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[bib] path` | `BIB_FILE` | path | `papers/bibliography.bib` |
| `[content] dir` | `CONTENT_DIR` | path | `content` |

- **`[bib] path`** -- the BibTeX export `src/bib_reader.py` parses. The
  only source of citekeys; nothing in the pipeline invents or renames
  one. Gitignored per-host data.
- **`[content] dir`** -- everything every layer writes: `sync`'s
  `ledger.sqlite` and `parsed/`, the drafting layer's `drafts/`,
  `dossiers/` and `rendered/`, the review layer's `review/`, and
  `docling/`, `chroma/` and `topics.json` from the enrichment stages.
  Since 3.17.0 it is also what every tier-1 command that takes a path
  will *accept*: `citation_gate`, `references` and `render_output` each
  refuse a path that resolves outside it, and since 4.0.0 so do all
  three of `src.review`'s aids. `ledger` is the one that takes no path
  argument at all -- its CLI only ever addresses rows by citekey or
  status -- so the rule applies to it vacuously rather than needing a
  check. This one
  directory is then the whole record of the work, and a copy of it is
  complete.

There is no key for "extra PDFs to enrich": the enrichment layer indexes
the bibliography and nothing else, so everything it can retrieve is
something a draft may cite. To add a paper, catalogue it in your
reference manager, re-export, and re-run `sync` -- see
[ZOTERO.md](ZOTERO.md).

### `[render]` -- citation style

Used only by `src/render_output.py`, never by `sync` or the
citation gate.

| Key | Env var | Accepts | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `csl` | `CSL_STYLE` | path | `assets/csl/ieee.csl` |
| `collapse_citations` | `RENDER_COLLAPSE_CITATIONS` | boolean | `true` |

- **`csl`** -- the CSL style pandoc's `--citeproc` formats citations and
  the bibliography with. The IEEE style ships with this repo (vendored,
  not fetched: rendering has to work with no network, and a style that
  changed underneath a draft would renumber one already reviewed). Point
  it at any other `.csl` file to use a different style;
  [the CSL project](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles)
  publishes several thousand. Without this, pandoc falls back to Chicago
  author-date. Relative to the repo root here, as with every other path
  setting; `render_output`'s `--csl` flag additionally accepts a path
  relative to the current directory, since that is what a shell-typed
  path means.
- **`collapse_citations`** -- whether a run of consecutive numbers
  collapses: `[3]–[6]` rather than `[3], [4], [5], [6]`. The IEEE
  Reference Guide's own examples use the collapsed form, but upstream
  `ieee.csl` does not produce it, so `render_output.py` injects the one
  CSL attribute that does (`collapse="citation-number"`) into a temp copy
  of the style. Set `false` to render whatever the style on disk says,
  unmodified. A style that already sets `collapse` itself is never
  overridden. See `assets/csl/README.md`.

### `[parser]` -- PDF text extraction

| Key | Env var | Accepts | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `backend` | `PARSER` | `"pdftotext"` \| `"docling"` | `"pdftotext"` |
| `ocr` | `PARSER_OCR` | boolean | `false` |
| `workers` | `PARSER_WORKERS` | positive integer, or `"auto"` | `1` |
| `start_method` | `PARSER_START_METHOD` | `"auto"` \| `"forkserver"` \| `"spawn"` | `"auto"` |
| `document_timeout` | `PARSER_DOCUMENT_TIMEOUT` | positive number of seconds, or `"off"` | `"off"` |
| `stall_timeout` | `PARSER_STALL_TIMEOUT` | positive number of seconds, or `"off"` | `1800` |
| `long_word_chars` | `PARSE_LONG_WORD_CHARS` | number, used as an integer | `20` |
| `long_word_ratio` | `PARSE_LONG_WORD_RATIO` | number, a fraction 0.0-1.0 | `0.01` |
| `min_tokens` | `PARSE_MIN_TOKENS` | number, used as an integer | `200` |

The values in full:

- **`backend`** -- `"pdftotext"` needs the `pdftotext` binary on `PATH`
  and no Python package; `"docling"` needs the `enrich` dependency group.
  Any other value is rejected, naming the valid ones. See
  [notes](#backend-pdftotext-or-docling).
- **`ocr`** -- only `docling` has an OCR stage; `pdftotext` ignores this.
- **`workers`** -- `1` takes a strictly serial path: no pool, no
  subprocesses, nothing about a run changes. An integer above 1, or
  `"auto"`, opts into a worker pool. The resolved count is **clamped**
  rather than obeyed blindly -- see
  [notes](#workers-and-how-it-is-clamped). `0`, negative numbers, and
  `true`/`false` are rejected at load.
- **`start_method`** -- consulted only when `workers > 1` **and**
  `backend = "docling"`; nothing else here uses a process pool.
  - `"auto"` -- `forkserver` where the platform has it (Linux, macOS),
    `spawn` where it does not (Windows).
  - `"forkserver"` -- one helper process imports torch and docling; every
    worker is forked from it.
  - `"spawn"` -- a fresh interpreter per worker, importing everything
    itself.
  - `"fork"` is **not** accepted -- see [notes](#why-fork-is-not-an-option).
- **`document_timeout`** / **`stall_timeout`** -- a positive number of
  seconds, or one of `"off"`, `"none"`, `"false"`, or an empty string,
  all meaning "no limit". `0` and negative numbers are **rejected**
  rather than read as "off", because "zero seconds" is the opposite of
  what someone writing it means. Integers and floats both work
  (`stall_timeout = 90.5` is valid).
- **`long_word_chars`** / **`min_tokens`** -- any number; the fractional
  part is truncated.
- **`long_word_ratio`** -- a fraction between 0.0 and 1.0. The range is
  not enforced, so a value above 1.0 loads fine and simply disables the
  warning, since no document can exceed it.

### `[logging]` -- the pipeline log file

| Key | Env var | Accepts | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `level` | `LOGGING_LEVEL` | `"DEBUG"` \| `"INFO"` \| `"WARNING"` \| `"ERROR"` \| `"CRITICAL"` | `"INFO"` |

- **`level`** -- how much the pipeline writes to `logs/pipeline.log`
  (rotated at 5 MB, 5 backups kept -- fixed in code, not configurable).
  Case-insensitive; any other value is rejected, naming the valid ones.
  Only affects the file: terminal output is the same regardless of this
  setting. This is the only `[logging]` key -- rotation size and backup
  count haven't needed to vary per host. See
  [CLI.md's "Running sync on a schedule"](CLI.md#running-sync-on-a-schedule).

  **One file, shared.** Both `python -m src.sync` and
  `src/enrich/__main__.py` write here, and each line names its source
  (`src.sync`, `src.enrich`, `src.enrich.docling_parse`), so
  `grep 'src\.sync' logs/pipeline.log` recovers a per-command view. The
  file is shared rather than split per command because that is what
  makes it safe: a rotating file can only have one writer process at a
  time, and these two already exclude each other through the pipeline
  write lock. Commands that don't take that lock -- `src.retrieval`,
  `src.citation_gate`, `src.references`, `src.dossier` and the rest of
  the drafting-layer CLIs -- write to stdout only and are not logged.

The log file's own location, `logs/` beside the repo root, has no
`config.toml` key -- but does still honor a `LOGS_DIR` environment
variable, the same escape hatch every path in this file gets, for a
script (or a test) that needs it somewhere else.

### `[provenance]` -- citation-support bands

| Key | Env var | Accepts | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `weak_score` | `PROVENANCE_WEAK_SCORE` | number, a fraction 0.0-1.0 | `0.20` |
| `good_score` | `PROVENANCE_GOOD_SCORE` | number, a fraction 0.0-1.0 | `0.50` |

`src/review/citation_provenance.py` (the review layer) bands the fraction of a citing sentence's
distinctive words found in the best-matching source passage. Below
`weak_score` a finding reads "no support found", which means *go look at
this one first* -- never "this citation is wrong". At or above
`good_score` it is banded "supported".

Round numbers on purpose: the report sets a reading order for a human,
not a pass/fail line, so tuning them precisely would be false precision.
Neither is range-checked, and nothing enforces
`weak_score < good_score`.

### `[enrich]` -- the optional enrichment layer

Used only by `src/enrich/*` (the `enrich` dependency group), never by
`sync` or the citation gate.

| Key | Env var | Accepts | Default in code | In `config.toml.example` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `embedding_model` | `EMBEDDING_MODEL` | a sentence-transformers model id | `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` |
| `docling_images` | `DOCLING_IMAGES` | boolean | `false` | `false` |
| `docling_image_scale` | `DOCLING_IMAGE_SCALE` | number | `2.0` | `2.0` |

**The two `embedding_model` columns differ on purpose, and the
distinction matters.** The code's fallback is the smaller, faster
MiniLM -- what you get if the key is absent. The shipped example sets the
larger, more accurate mpnet, so anyone who copied `config.toml.example`
is running mpnet. Check your own file rather than assuming either. See
[Choosing an embedding model](#choosing-an-embedding-model).

## How values are parsed

Worth knowing, because two of these will surprise you.

**Booleans from the environment.** In TOML, write `true` / `false`. From
an environment variable, only `1`, `true`, `yes`, `on`
(case-insensitive) mean true -- **anything else is false**, including
typos. That is deliberate: `bool("false")` is `True` in Python, so
without it every documented way of turning a setting off via the
environment would silently turn it on.

**A wrong TOML type falls back silently.** String and boolean settings
return their default when the value has the wrong type, rather than
raising. So `ocr = "true"` -- a string, not a boolean -- is read as the
default `false`, with no complaint. Quote strings; don't quote booleans
or numbers.

**Four settings are validated at load and fail loudly:** `workers`,
`start_method`, `document_timeout`, `stall_timeout`. A bad value raises
immediately, naming the key, the environment variable, and what was
expected -- rather than surfacing much later as a nonsense pool size or a
strange timeout.

## Notes on individual settings

### `backend`: pdftotext or docling

`src/pdf_text.py` dispatches through a table, so adding a backend is one
function plus one entry -- and two candidates were added and later
removed through that same seam.

| Backend | Dependency | Page boundaries? | Quotable passages? | Speed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pdftotext` (default) | `poppler-utils` on `PATH` | **Yes** -- form feeds between pages | No -- reading order is lost | Fastest |
| `docling` | `docling`, `enrich` group | **Yes** -- form feeds between pages | **Yes** -- writes a passage sidecar | ~42x slower; see [PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md#parserbackend----pdftotext-or-docling) |

**Page boundaries are not cosmetic, which is why both backends now keep
them.** `src/review/verbatim_check.py` reports which PDF page a verbatim run
came from by splitting on those form feeds; before `docling` asked for
them, a citekey parsed that way reported `pdf p.1` for every hit
regardless of where the text sat.

**What separates the two backends now is quoting, not paging.**
`pdftotext -layout` preserves a page's visual arrangement rather than its
reading order, so an excerpt cut from it can splice two columns together;
the passage ladder therefore refuses to quote from it and reports a page
number instead. `docling` resolves reading order, and the corpus layer
keeps that resolution as `content/parsed/<citekey>.passages.json` -- so
choosing it here buys real quotable passages without running the
enrichment layer at all. The mechanism is in
[CITATION-PROVENANCE.md](CITATION-PROVENANCE.md#what-the-corpus-layer-keeps-when-it-uses-docling),
and the ladder it feeds is in [LADDERS.md](LADDERS.md#ladder-1-evidence-passages).

[PDF-PARSER.md](PDF-PARSER.md) has the full fidelity comparison.

**Setting `backend = "docling"` does not fold docling into the
enrichment layer, and does not make `src/enrich/docling_parse.py` redundant.**
They are two consumers of the same library, with different scopes:

- **`src/pdf_text.py`** (the corpus layer, on `sync`) extracts plain text per
  citekey into `content/parsed/<citekey>.txt` for BM25 retrieval, plus the
  passage sidecar beside it. docling here is a higher-fidelity substitute
  for `pdftotext`'s job.
- **`src/enrich/docling_parse.py`** (the enrichment layer, opt-in) produces
  structured
  Markdown for the whole corpus into `content/docling/`, feeding the
  embedding and topic stages that need real reading order and section
  boundaries. It **always** uses docling regardless of this setting, over
  exactly the same ledger documents -- it has no corpus of its own.

They no longer duplicate the parse, though. When this setting is
`docling`, the enrichment stage adopts the corpus layer's output for a
citekey instead of parsing the PDF a second time -- a file copy in place
of 6.65s per document. It falls back to a real parse for a citekey the
corpus layer wrote no text for -- a PDF whose parse failed at sync time,
say -- for a run with `[enrich].docling_images` on, because the corpus
layer writes no figure bitmaps to adopt, or when the artefacts are older
than the PDF, which means the PDF has been replaced since the corpus
layer read it. The dependency only ever runs that way round: the
enrichment layer reads the corpus layer's files, and the corpus layer is
not shaped by this at all.

### `workers`, and how it is clamped

The resolved count is the smallest of three ceilings, never below 1:

1. what you asked for,
2. what the machine can sustain,
3. how many documents actually need parsing.

The third matters more than it looks: standing up 12 docling workers to
parse 3 documents pays 12 model loads to save two documents' work.

"What the machine can sustain" counts the CPUs **this process may run
on** -- not the machine's total, which on a shared or containerised
machine can be far larger. For `docling` that count is divided by 4:

| CPUs available to the process | 4 | 8 | 16 | 48 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `workers = "auto"` resolves to | 1 | 2 | 4 | 12 |

**That divisor of 4 is measurably too conservative.** It models a docling
worker as occupying about 4 CPUs, which a full-corpus sweep does not
support: at 32 workers the CPU is only ~70% busy, and 32 workers run
**1.41x faster** than the 12 this table allows -- and 48 workers are no
worse, so the honest reading is "much smaller than 4", not a specific
replacement. Changing it is a behaviour change and has not been
made -- see
[PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md#parserworkers----document-level-parallelism).

So a four-core desktop resolves to 2, and asking for 15 there still gets
2 -- **clamped and said out loud on stderr**, rather than silently obeyed
(which thrashes) or silently ignored. docling's own internal thread count
is divided down to match, so workers x threads still fits.

**Two things the clamp cannot see:** a cgroup CPU *quota*
(`docker --cpus=2`) throttles without changing which CPUs are permitted,
and RAM is not considered at all. Set an explicit number on either.

Each backend gets the concurrency it can use: processes for `docling`
(in-process, holds the GIL), threads for `pdftotext` (an external
subprocess that releases it). Ledger writes always stay on the main
process -- sqlite has a single writer -- and results are reported in
bibliography order regardless of which worker finished first, so two
identical runs still print identically.

### Using more than one GPU

Nothing to configure. With `docling` and more than one worker, each
worker claims one CUDA device round-robin -- docling's own
`AcceleratorDevice.AUTO` resolves to `cuda:0` in *every* process, so
without this every worker would pile onto card 0 while the rest idle.

Restrict which cards are used with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`; the pool only
ever sees what that leaves visible. Figures in
[PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md#multi-gpu----nothing-to-configure).

**A card someone else is already using is skipped**, and the run says so
on stderr:

```
  WARNING skipping cuda:0 (0.6 GiB free) -- under 2.5 GiB free, which is
  not enough for a docling worker. Parsing on cuda:1,2,3.
```

That threshold is a worker's ~1.7 GiB of models plus its CUDA context.
The check matters more than it sounds: a worker that cannot get device
memory fails a document in seconds where a working one takes minutes, and
the pool hands the next document to whichever worker is free first — so
without this, the broken workers take most of the corpus. If every card
is busy the run parses on the CPU (slower, but it finishes), and a worker
that runs out of device memory *during* a run falls back to the CPU for
its remaining documents rather than failing them.

Nothing to configure here either — but if you would rather wait for a
card than parse on the CPU, the warning is your cue to stop and re-run
later.

### Why `fork` is not an option

Not an oversight. By the time the pool is built, the process holds two
live sqlite connections -- the run lock and the ledger -- and SQLite's
own documentation says not to carry an open connection across `fork()`.
`forkserver` starts its server as a fresh interpreter, so workers inherit
the preloaded modules and nothing else. It also measured **no slower**
than plain `fork`, so nothing is given up.

Both available start methods re-import the calling program's `__main__`
in each worker, so a script of your own driving `sync` or `parse_corpus`
must guard its top level with `if __name__ == "__main__":`.

### The two timeouts are not the same guard

- **`document_timeout`** bounds one document, and the two backends
  enforce it with unequal strength. For `pdftotext` it is a subprocess
  timeout -- a real kill, the one case where a wedged parse can actually
  be stopped. For `docling` it is that library's own check *between*
  pipeline stages: it bounds a pathologically slow document but will not
  interrupt a hang inside a single stage.
- **`stall_timeout`** bounds a *parallel run*, by asking whether **any**
  document at all has completed recently. With several workers,
  completions arrive constantly, so total silence across the whole pool
  separates a hung worker from a merely slow document far better than any
  per-document number could. It applies only when `workers > 1`; a serial
  run has no pool to go silent.

`stall_timeout` is on by default, unlike most safety valves here, because
the failure it catches is one a user actually hit: a run that never
finishes. A false positive is cheap -- outstanding documents are marked
failed and retried next run, not lost -- and a warning is printed at half
the budget before anything is given up on.

Either way a timed-out document is **reported as a failure, not silently
truncated** -- but what happens next differs, because the two guards
blame different things:

- A **`document_timeout`** casualty is named on its own line in `sync`'s
  summary (`WARNING: 2 document(s) hit the 120.0s
  [parser].document_timeout and were not parsed: <citekeys>`), and is
  **not** retried. The limit that expired is a setting, so the next run
  under the same setting would spend the same minutes to reach the same
  answer. Raise `document_timeout` and re-run with `--reparse`.
- A **`stall_timeout`** casualty *is* retried, automatically: those
  documents were never given a fair attempt, so they are recorded as
  transient failures and come back next run.

Choosing a safe value means knowing your slowest legitimate document; see
[PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md#parserdocument_timeout----what-a-safe-value-looks-like).

### The parse-quality guard

`sync` warns when an implausible share of a freshly extracted document's
words are unusually long -- the signature of a backend that has lost the
spaces between words. That is easy to miss by eye and expensive
downstream: `src/retrieval.py` tokenises on runs of `[a-z0-9]`, so two
words that lost the space between them become a single token and neither
one matches a query for it any more.

`long_word_chars`, `long_word_ratio` and `min_tokens` are its thresholds.
It is **a warning, never a failure** -- the text is still usable, and an
unusual corpus could trip it legitimately. It will not catch a bad `ocr`
choice: it looks for run-together words, not for content that never
arrived.

### `docling_images`

Extracts figure bitmaps into `content/docling/<doc>_artifacts/`, plus a
`<doc>.figures.json` giving each figure's page, caption, and the exact
string to cite it by.

Those images are a **reading aid** for checking a draft against its
sources. They are never inserted into a draft: a figure's copyright is
not the paper's citekey to grant. See
[DEVELOPER.md](../DEVELOPER.md#figures-and-copyright).

Changing this invalidates the whole docling cache, so the next run
re-parses the corpus from scratch. Costs in
[PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md#enrichdocling_images----disk-and-a-full-re-parse).

## Choosing an embedding model

`src/enrich/embed_index.py` calls
`SentenceTransformer(config.EMBEDDING_MODEL).encode(...)`
**symmetrically** -- the same call embeds a 200-word document chunk
(40-word overlap) and a search query, with no prefix or instruction text
added on either side.

That one fact decides which models are drop-in and which are not.

### Drop-in

| Model | Dimensions | Relative cost | Best for | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (code default) | 384 | Lowest -- ~22M params, fast even on CPU | Small corpora, quick iteration, CPU-only machines | Least semantic nuance of the three; general-purpose training data, nothing science-specific |
| `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` (example default) | 768 | ~4-5x MiniLM -- comfortable on a GPU, noticeably slower CPU-only | Meaningfully better general-purpose semantic quality | More RAM/VRAM and slower indexing/search, for a gain that may not matter at a small corpus size |
| `sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1` | 768 | Same class as `all-mpnet-base-v2` | Trained specifically on short-query-vs-long-passage retrieval -- the closest match to what `search()` actually does | Slightly weaker on generic sentence similarity outside retrieval |

What each one is:

- **`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`** -- a 6-layer transformer distilled from a larger
  model, then fine-tuned on roughly a billion general sentence pairs with
  contrastive learning, so semantically similar sentences land close
  together. That symmetric objective is exactly what the prefix-free
  `encode()` call needs, which is why it is the code default. ~22M
  parameters, fast on CPU alone.
- **`all-mpnet-base-v2`** -- the same recipe on a larger 12-layer MPNet
  backbone (~109M parameters). Generally the strongest all-around
  sentence-transformers model for semantic similarity with no domain
  specialisation. The extra quality costs roughly 4-5x the compute and
  doubles the vector dimensionality, which doubles per-chunk storage in
  Chroma and slows similarity search somewhat.
- **`multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1`** -- the same MPNet backbone, fine-tuned
  on ~215M question/answer and query/passage pairs for dot-product
  retrieval rather than generic similarity. Conceptually the closest
  match to a short query against a longer chunk, and it needs no prefix,
  so it stays a clean drop-in. Same cost profile as `all-mpnet-base-v2`.

### Not without a code change first

- **`allenai/specter` / `specter2`** -- a SciBERT-based model trained on
  scientific title+abstract pairs using citation graphs as the signal. It
  is built for whole-paper similarity, not passage retrieval, and expects
  a specific input shape (title `[SEP]` abstract) that does not match the
  arbitrary 200-word body chunks this pipeline produces. Using it well
  means feeding it titles and abstracts -- a real code change -- and even
  then it answers "which papers are alike", a different question than
  "which chunk answers this query".
- **BAAI `bge-*` and `intfloat e5-*` families** -- strong on public
  retrieval benchmarks, but they expect literal `"query: "` /
  `"passage: "` prefixes baked into the input so the model knows which
  role each side plays. Nothing here adds one. Feeding either in as-is
  **will not error -- it will silently underperform**, which is the worst
  failure mode of the set. Adopting one means pairing it with matching
  prefix-handling code, not a config-only swap.

### Switching

Edit `[enrich].embedding_model`, or set `EMBEDDING_MODEL=...` for a single
run, then rebuild the index:

```bash
python3 -m src.enrich --stages embed
```

The model downloads on first use (needs network), and Chroma's existing
collection is **not** re-embedded automatically -- switch only when you
are prepared to rebuild the index.
