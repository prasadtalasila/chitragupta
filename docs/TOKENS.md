# Tokens

Status: **reasoning document.** Written 2026-08-08.

Where a drafting run's tokens actually go, which of the two pools each
cost lands in, what the dossier does and does not recover -- and how to
put a number on any of it without paying for a full seven-phase run.

The token accounting lives here, in one place.
[DRAFT-ITERATION.md](DRAFT-ITERATION.md) and
[REJECTION.md](REJECTION.md) keep their own subjects -- the dossier, and
why a retrieval change was withdrawn -- and defer the arithmetic to this
document.

## The two pools

The useful split is not "input versus output". It is **where a token
sits**, because that decides how many times it is billed:

| Pool | Billed | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Orchestrator-resident** | once per turn, for every remaining turn of the run | retrieval snippets read inline, returned interview packets, the assembled draft, every tool result |
| **Subagent one-shot** | once | anything read or written inside a dispatched subagent, discarded when it returns |

A subagent's context is destroyed when it hands back its packet. An
orchestrator's is not: it is **append-only between compactions**, and the
whole of it is re-sent on every subsequent turn. So the same 500-character
snippet costs one unit inside a subagent and one unit per remaining turn
in the main run. That difference, not the byte count, is what makes a
drafting run expensive.

### What caching changes, and what it does not

Prompt caching blunts the resident pool without removing it. The
structural ratios -- stable across Claude models, and ratios rather than
prices so they do not go stale -- are:

| | Multiple of base input |
|---|---|
| Uncached input | 1x |
| Cache write (5-minute TTL) | 1.25x |
| Cache read | 0.1x |
| Output | 5x |

Two consequences run through everything below.

**A resident token is roughly a tenth of a fresh one, not free.** Twenty
turns of cached residency come to `20 x 0.1` = 2x the base rate, against
1.25x to put the material in context in the first place -- so a long run
pays more to keep a snippet than it paid to fetch it. But any figure
computed as `bytes x turns` overstates the bill by about six times if it
forgets the 0.1x, which is an easy mistake to make in this direction.

**Output is the expensive direction, at 50x a cached input token.**
Anything the orchestrator *writes* -- a draft, a dossier entry, a
dispatch prompt pasted full of packet material -- is the costliest thing
it does per token. A fix that trades resident input for extra output can
easily lose.

## The resident multiplier

The quantity that matters is not how many tokens a phase produces but

```text
resident cost = tokens entering context x turns remaining in the run
```

and the second factor is a property of the **skill**, not of the topic.
`survey-writer` has 15 numbered steps, of which retrieval is step 1;
`deep-research` has seven phases, and Phase 7 alone mandates a peer-review
dispatch, a reconciliation, an assembly, a provenance write, a gate run,
a references build, three renders, two dossier writes and a presentation.
Neither count changes if you ask about digital twins instead of runtime
verification.

This is why the cheapest place to spend attention is the *earliest* one.
A token that enters context in step 1 is multiplied by everything after
it; a token that enters at the presentation step is billed once.

## Where the tokens go

**Every figure in this section is an estimate**, derived from file sizes
in `content/drafts/` and the defaults documented in the genre skills.
Nothing here counts tokens directly: the closest this repository gets is
`retrieval.md`, which records the *character* payload of each retrieval
call for one draft. Read the ratios, not the absolute numbers.

### 1. Retrieved candidates that never leave context

`survey-writer` step 1 calls `search(sub_theme, k=15)` for two to four
sub-themes, over-fetching on purpose. Each `SearchResult` carries a
citekey, a title, a score and a 500-character snippet -- **an estimated
~150 tokens each**, so 30-60 results is an estimated **4.5k-9k tokens per
retrieval pass**. Step 3 then tells you to reformulate and search again
when a sub-theme comes up thin.

The sharp part is what happens next. `reference.md` §1 sets "results kept
per query ~ top 3" out of fifteen. **The roughly 80% that get rejected
cost exactly what the kept ones cost, and then stay resident for the rest
of the run anyway.** Rejecting a candidate saves no tokens at all; it only
saves you from citing it. [REJECTION.md](REJECTION.md) is the full
argument, including why a cheaper first read aimed at this cost was built
and then withdrawn.

### 2. Fan-out results held across phases

`deep-research` Phase 2 dispatches six interviewers and holds their
packets through Phases 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 -- the contradiction map, the
outline, the section writers, the polish pass and the peer-review
reconciliation all read them. An estimated ~1k tokens per packet is ~6k
tokens resident across the longest stretch of the run. This is the
subject of
[#74](https://github.com/prasadtalasila/chitragupta/issues/74), and
["What the dossier actually recovers"](#what-the-dossier-actually-recovers)
below is careful about which part of it a dossier can and cannot remove.
The half that could be removed now has been: Phase 5 dispatches through
`python -m src.draft dossier brief` rather than pasting the packets into four
prompts. The residency itself is untouched, and the reason it cannot be
touched from inside a run is the subject of that section.

### 3. Whole-file rewrites

`content/drafts/digital-twins-for-software-engineers/survey.md` is 18.3
KB, an estimated **~4.6k output tokens to write once** -- and output is
the 5x direction. A draft rewritten whole for each revision pays that
every time, including for a gate failure that touches one citekey.

### 4. No revision path at all

This was the big one, and it is what `src/dossier.py` plus the
`draft-reviser` skill exist to remove. Before them, no genre skill had a
branch for "an existing draft plus a change request", so the only way to
alter a paragraph was to run every step again. That is a **structural**
cost -- a whole run you should not have had to make -- rather than a
constant factor on a run you make anyway, which is why it was fixed
first.

## Two worked examples

Both are derived, not measured, and both are written in **input-token
equivalents**: a cached resident token counts 0.1, a cache write 1.25, an
output token 5. Multiplying raw token counts by turn counts, without
those weights, is the specific error these examples exist to avoid.

### Example 1: one rejected paper, followed to the end of the run

A `survey-writer` run on a topic broken into three sub-themes.

| Step | What happens | Tokens |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `search --k 15` x 3 sub-themes | 45 results x ~150 = ~6.7k |
| 2 | ~3 kept per query, 12 rejected | ~1.4k kept, **~5.4k rejected** |
| 2-14 | thirteen further numbered steps, an estimated 20+ orchestrator turns | nothing evicted |

The 5.4k tokens of rejected candidates are the interesting half. Costed
properly:

- entering context once: `5.4k x 1.25` = **6.8k equivalents**
- resident across ~20 further turns: `5.4k x 0.1 x 20` = **10.8k**
- total: **~17.6k input-token equivalents, for material cited nowhere.**

Three things follow. The rejected candidates cost **4x what the kept ones
do**, because there are four times as many of them and residency does not
care which is which. **Rejecting harder saves nothing** -- the tokens were
spent at retrieval; a rejection only prevents a citation. And the naive
figure, `5.4k x 20 = 108k`, overstates the bill by about six times: the
honest unit is the multiplier, not the raw product.

What *does* help is the subagent boundary. Dispatch one subagent per
sub-theme and the 45 results are read inside three contexts that are then
discarded; only the kept evidence comes back. The same 5.4k of rejects
lands in the one-shot pool at 1.25x once -- about **6.8k equivalents,
against 17.6k** -- and the saving grows with every turn the run still has
to make.

### Example 2: six interview packets, from Phase 3 to Phase 7f

A `standard`-depth `deep-research` run: five personas plus the Basic fact
writer, packets estimated at ~1k tokens each.

| | Tokens |
|---|---|
| Six packets returning into the orchestrator | ~6k |
| Cache write when they arrive | `6k x 1.25` = 7.5k |
| Resident across an estimated 22 turns of Phases 3-7 | `6k x 0.1 x 22` = 13.2k |
| **Total residency** | **~20.7k equivalents** |

Set beside that the two costs the same packets incur *outside* the
resident pool:

- **Transcription into the dossier.** `SKILL.md` already requires the
  kept claims into `evidence.md` and the discarded citekeys into
  `rejected.md`. Say ~4k output tokens: `4k x 5` = **20k equivalents** --
  as much as the entire residency, paid once, and paid for durability
  rather than for speed. It is not a saving and was never billed as one.
- **Phase 5 dispatch prompts.** Each section writer *was* handed "the
  relevant citekeys plus supporting facts", which the orchestrator emits
  as *output*. Four writers x ~800 tokens of packet-derived material is
  3.2k output = **16k equivalents**.

That last row is the one #74 could actually collect, and it is why the
answer is a file rather than better summarising. **Implemented**: the
pasted material is now the one line
`python -m src.draft dossier brief <draft> --section "<heading>"`, an
estimated 40 output tokens per writer, ~0.8k equivalents.
**An estimated 15k equivalents saved, in the 5x direction**, which is the
same order as the entire resident cost the issue set out to attack,
arrived at from the opposite side.
[DRAFT-ITERATION.md](DRAFT-ITERATION.md#dispatching-from-the-dossier) has
the mechanism and why it addresses by section rather than by citekey
list.

## What the dossier actually recovers

The issue's diagnosis is right about where the cost is and needs one
correction about the mechanism, which is worth stating plainly because it
changes what a fix should optimise.

**Residency cannot be undone from inside a run.** The orchestrator's
context is append-only between compactions. Once six packets have been
returned into it, writing them to disk does not remove them -- reading an
extract back *adds* tokens. There is no eviction primitive, so "hold the
extract instead of the packet" is not something a skill can do to a turn
that has already happened.

So of the resident 20.7k in Example 2, a dossier recovers **none** within
that run. What it does recover:

| Effect | Pool | Why it is real | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 5 dispatch prompts shrink to a file reference | output, 5x | The orchestrator stops re-emitting packet material once per writer | **implemented** (3.10.0, `dossier brief`) |
| Subagents read only the rows they need | subagent one-shot | Four writers each receive a command instead of a paste | **implemented** (3.10.0) |
| Compaction stops being lossy | resident | A compacted run can recover exact packet detail from disk instead of re-dispatching six interviewers -- the single largest cost in the skill | implemented by the transcription (`c4fbd9a`) |
| The next run skips Phase 2 entirely | structural | `draft-reviser` reads `evidence.md` and `rejected.md`; no interviews at all | implemented by the transcription (`c4fbd9a`) |

The third row is the underrated one. Today a long run that hits
compaction either loses packet detail silently or pays six interviewer
dispatches to get it back. With the packets on disk, compaction becomes a
cheap operation instead of a lossy one -- which is a *resident*-pool
effect, but an indirect one.

### The one way to cut residency, and what it would cost

Residency can only be avoided by **not putting the material in the
orchestrator at all**. That collides with a rule the skill states
deliberately: the main run owns the dossier, and a subagent never writes
it (`.claude/skills/deep-research/SKILL.md`, "The dossier"). The three
subagent definitions enforce it structurally -- `tools: Bash, Read, Grep,
Glob`, with no `Write` or `Edit` -- and each is told in prose that it
writes no files.

**A proposal, not a plan:** relax that rule for exactly one shape --
**one file per subagent, written once, never read by a sibling**. Each
interviewer writes `content/dossiers/<draft>/interviews/<persona>.md` and
returns a short packet: claims, citekeys, one-line reasons. The long-form
material never enters the orchestrator, so the residency is never
incurred; the orchestrator reads back only what Phase 3 needs to build
the contradiction map.

What it buys is the only remaining reduction of the resident pool. What
it costs is the invariant that makes the dossier trustworthy -- one
writer, one record, verifiable by reading one skill file -- and it is
exactly the invariant that keeps
[the synchronisation questions below](#who-writes-a-packet-down-and-when)
answerable. It is written down here so the trade is visible, not because
it is recommended, and it is deliberately not taken: `brief` only
*reads* the dossier, and the three subagent definitions carry no
`Write` tool.

## Why deep-research has no lever left

The claim in [#74](https://github.com/prasadtalasila/chitragupta/issues/74)
-- that the fan-out payload was the only remaining way to cut
`deep-research`'s token cost -- was reached by elimination, and the
eliminations are each recorded elsewhere:

| Lever | Status for this skill |
|---|---|
| Remove the structural cost (no revision path) | Done -- `src/dossier.py` plus `draft-reviser` |
| Trim what retrieval returns (two-stage triage) | Withdrawn. See [REJECTION.md](REJECTION.md): `deep-research`'s reads already happen inside subagents, so triage optimises the *cheap* pool, adds an estimated 270 further process starts at standard depth, and discards exactly the qualifying passages contradiction mapping exists to find |
| Move reads behind the subagent boundary | Done -- Phases 2, 5 and 7 all dispatch |
| Cut the fan-out payload the orchestrator carries and re-emits | Done in 3.10.0 -- `dossier brief`, an estimated 15k equivalents |
| Cut the residency itself | **Not available** without one file per subagent, and [the trade above](#the-one-way-to-cut-residency-and-what-it-would-cost) is refused |

The elimination was a real conclusion rather than an accident of what was
left: the dispatch payload was the one substantial thing the skill put in
the expensive pool and then re-emitted by hand. With it gone, the honest
statement of where this skill now stands is that its remaining cost is
**structural to the genre** -- seven phases, a dozen subagents, and six
packets that have to enter the orchestrator for Phase 3 to compare them
against each other. A cheaper multi-perspective report is a different
skill, not a further optimisation of this one; `survey-writer` is that
skill, and the guardrails already say to point users there.

The dependency the issue records is also stale, in the direction of being
already satisfied. It lists itself as blocked by
[#81](https://github.com/prasadtalasila/chitragupta/issues/81), which is
closed -- the dossier wiring landed in `c4fbd9a`, and
`.claude/skills/deep-research/SKILL.md` has required the Phase 2
transcription since. That was the write half; 3.10.0 is the
dispatch-prompt half, and the two only work together. A run that skips
the transcription now finds out at Phase 5, because `brief` exits 1 and
names the citekey it has no block for.

## The one lever this repository does not own

Everything above is a lever on *what enters context*. There is one lever
on *what the work is priced at*, it belongs to the user rather than to
this repository, and a user who wants cheaper subagents needs nothing from
here to get them:

```console
export CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL=haiku
```

Claude Code resolves a subagent's model from that environment variable
first, then the per-invocation parameter, then the agent's `model:`
frontmatter -- which defaults to `inherit`, the session's model. So the
variable applies to **every** subagent dispatched by every skill here:
`survey-writer` step 2a, and `deep-research` Phases 2, 5 and 7. Nothing in
this repository can override it, and nothing here tries to.

Three things are worth being exact about, because the size of the saving
is easy to overstate and the cost of it is easy to miss.

**It discounts the pool that was already cheap.** A subagent is the
one-shot pool from [the two pools](#the-two-pools): billed once, discarded
on return. The variable applies a constant factor to that half and does
nothing to residency, which is the multiplier this whole document is
about. It makes an expensive run somewhat cheaper; it does not change
which runs are expensive.

**It is all-or-nothing, and two of the four sites should not be
cheapened.** `survey-writer` step 2a returns the *rejected* list, and
`rejected.md` makes a rejection permanent --
[REJECTION.md](REJECTION.md) and SOUL.md both make that the load-bearing,
irreversible judgment in the pipeline. `draft-reviser` repairing a
citation-gate failure has to choose between correcting a claim and
removing it, and its own text forbids the third option
(`draft-reviser/SKILL.md`: *"never 'fix' a gate failure by inventing a
plausible-looking key -- correct it or remove the claim"*). Setting the
variable downgrades both along with
everything else. That is a legitimate choice to make knowingly, and this
document's job is to make sure it is knowing.

**Use the aliases, not a pinned model ID.** `haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus` and
`fable` track the recommended version for the provider and move with it; a
full model name pins to one and rots silently as models are renamed and
retired. There is no model reference anywhere in `.claude/` for the same
reason.

*Asserted*, in the sense of ["Measured, derived, and
asserted"](#measured-derived-and-asserted) below: the resolution order and
the `inherit` default are properties of the harness, and the size of the
saving is unmeasured until
[#76](https://github.com/prasadtalasila/chitragupta/issues/76) lands.

## Who writes a packet down, and when

Two questions come up whenever this design is explained, and both have
answers that are properties of the current code rather than intentions.

**Do the later phases write the packets to disk?** No. Every write to
`content/dossiers/` is done by the orchestrating run, in the phase that
dispatched the subagent, before that phase closes. The subagents cannot
write: `deep-research-interviewer`, `deep-research-writer` and
`peer-reviewer` each declare `tools: Bash, Read, Grep, Glob` in their
frontmatter, and each is told in prose that it writes no files and that
anything not in its returned packet is lost when it exits. `Bash` is a
theoretical escape hatch; nothing instructs them through it.

The failure mode that remains is therefore **loss, not corruption**: an
orchestrator that moves to Phase 3 without transcribing has lost six
packets' worth of rejected citekeys. That used to be silent by
construction, which is why the skill states the transcription as a rule
of the skill rather than as a suggestion.

It is half-audible, and only because of a change made for a different
reason. Phase 5 dispatches through `dossier brief`, which exits
1 and names every citekey it has no block for, so a *kept* claim that was
never transcribed surfaces at the moment the section that needs it is
about to be written. A **rejected** citekey still fails silently: nothing
downstream asks for it, which is exactly why it is the expensive half to
lose -- the next session re-retrieves and re-judges those papers without
ever knowing it is repeating work. `dossier status` reporting "searched
and recorded nothing it found" remains the only signal there, and it is
after the fact.

**Is there a synchronisation risk?** Not on the current paths, and the
reason is worth knowing because it is narrower than "the module is safe".

- **One writer.** The orchestrator is single-threaded with respect to its
  own tool calls, and it is the only dossier writer. Concurrent
  modification of `evidence.md` or `rejected.md` cannot arise.
- **`init` cannot clobber.** `src.dossier.init` only creates files that
  are missing, so re-running it against a part-filled dossier adds what
  is absent and touches nothing else.
- **No locks, deliberately.** `src/dossier.py` takes no lock and is not a
  gate. It must not block behind a `sync` that is mid-run, and a
  bookkeeping write is never allowed to fail the work it was recording.

There is one path that *can* produce concurrent writers, and it is worth
naming because it was found by writing this document rather than by
anything failing. `python -m src.draft retrieve ... --log <draft>` appends to
the dossier's `retrieval.md`, and subagents can run Bash. Today only
`survey-writer` and `draft-reviser` pass `--log`, and both are single
orchestrators -- but give `--log` to six parallel interviewers and it is
live.

`log_retrieval` used to write the template when the file was absent and
then append the row, which lost data two different ways. Both are worth
knowing, because the second is what the obvious fix for the first turns
into:

- **A stale check.** `if not path.exists(): path.write_text(TEMPLATE)`
  truncates, and the check can go stale between the two calls, so a
  second writer destroys rows the first had already appended.
- **A file published before it is filled in.** Creating with mode `"x"`
  (`O_EXCL`) fixes the check, and introduces a narrower version of the
  same bug: the file becomes visible at zero length and *then* gets its
  template written from offset 0. A second writer that appends a row in
  that window has it overwritten. This one is microseconds wide, which
  means concurrent processes essentially never hit it and a smoke test
  proves nothing -- it has to be reproduced by forcing the interleaving.

What the module does now is write nothing at an offset: one append-mode
handle, and the template written only when that open finds the file
empty, so every byte lands at whatever the end of the file is at the time
of the write. The residual failure is a *duplicated header* when two
writers both find it empty -- observed, at 16 concurrent processes -- and
that is left in on purpose. It loses nothing: `retrieval_cost` skips any
row whose last cell is not an integer, which the header and its separator
both are, so all 16 rows still total correctly. Buying exactly-one-header
would cost a lock or a link-into-place dance, on the cheapest file in the
system.

That is also the general answer to "why not just lock it". A lock fixes
corruption, and the failure this section opened with is *loss* -- a
transcription that never happened, which no mutual exclusion can conjure.
It would also have to be skippable on timeout, since a bookkeeping write
may never fail the work it records, and a lock you are willing to skip is
not mutual exclusion. Meanwhile the per-persona-file proposal above
sidesteps the whole question by construction, since one file with one
writer never races -- at the price of the single-writer rule everywhere
else.

## Measuring this without writing a survey

Every figure above is derived. Turning them into numbers is
[#76](https://github.com/prasadtalasila/chitragupta/issues/76), and the
obvious way to do it -- run a full `standard`-depth `deep-research` on a
real topic, before and after -- is also the most expensive experiment
available and the least controlled, since two runs on the same topic do
not take the same number of turns. Four cheaper routes, in increasing
order of what they cost you.

### Free: the session transcript already has the answer

Claude Code writes a JSONL transcript per session under
`~/.claude/projects/<slugified-cwd>/<session-id>.jsonl`, and every
assistant entry carries a `usage` object with `input_tokens`,
`cache_read_input_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_tokens` and
`output_tokens`.

**Subagent turns are not in that file.** An earlier version of this
recipe said they were, flagged `isSidechain: true` in the same JSONL --
wrong, checked directly against this machine's own transcripts rather
than assumed: every subagent turn instead lives in its own file, under
`<session-id>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl`, a sibling directory of the
session file rather than a line inside it. The two pools still separate
empirically, from a run already paid for -- the fix is reading a second
set of files, not a different flag:

```python
import json
import sys
from pathlib import Path

def _pool_usage(paths):
    seen = set()
    turns = tokens_in = tokens_out = 0
    for path in paths:
        for line in path.open(encoding="utf-8"):
            try:
                entry = json.loads(line)
            except ValueError:
                continue
            usage = (entry.get("message") or {}).get("usage")
            rid = entry.get("requestId")
            if not usage or rid in seen:      # streaming writes an entry twice
                continue
            seen.add(rid)
            turns += 1
            tokens_in += (usage.get("input_tokens", 0)
                          + usage.get("cache_read_input_tokens", 0)
                          + usage.get("cache_creation_input_tokens", 0))
            tokens_out += usage.get("output_tokens", 0)
    return turns, tokens_in, tokens_out

session_file = Path(sys.argv[1])                       # <session-id>.jsonl
subagent_dir = session_file.with_suffix("") / "subagents"
subagent_files = sorted(subagent_dir.glob("*.jsonl")) if subagent_dir.is_dir() else []

for name, (turns, inp, outp) in (
    ("orchestrator", _pool_usage([session_file])),
    ("subagent", _pool_usage(subagent_files)),
):
    print(f"{name:13} turns {turns:4}  input {inp:12,}  output {outp:9,}"
          f"  mean input/turn {inp // max(turns, 1):,}")
```

This is a recipe, not shipped tooling -- it reads harness files this
project does not own, and the schema (this directory layout included) is
the harness's to change.

**On a session with no subagent dispatches**, `subagent_dir` doesn't
exist and the split is moot but the input:output ratio still holds: run
against the session that wrote this document's original draft -- a
documentation session, no drafting, no subagents -- it reports 35
orchestrator turns, **1,991,974 input tokens against 14,318 output
tokens**. That ratio, 139 input tokens per output token, is the resident
multiplier measured rather than argued, on a session doing nothing more
expensive than reading files and writing prose. De-duplicating on
`requestId` matters here too: summing naively inflated the same session
to 56 turns and 3.2M tokens.

**On a session that does dispatch subagents**, measured on two of this
machine's own multi-agent engineering sessions in this repository (not a
drafting run -- ordinary feature work using the `Agent` tool, the closest
real material available to check the fixed recipe against):

| Session | Orchestrator turns | Orchestrator input | Subagent turns (agents) | Subagent input |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | 199 | 34,902,281 | 93 (5) | 4,277,676 |
| B | 268 | 66,634,805 | 69 (4) | 3,555,862 |

Orchestrator input outweighs subagent input by roughly 8-19x on these two
-- the direction [the resident multiplier](#the-resident-multiplier)
predicts (the orchestrator's context is append-only and re-billed every
turn; a subagent's is paid once and discarded), but the ratio itself is
two data points from unrelated engineering sessions, not a
`deep-research` or `survey-writer` run, and should not be read as this
skill's own boundary saving. [The dispatch payload, measured on real
material](#the-dispatch-payload-measured-on-real-material) below is the
number that answers that question, for the one boundary it was measured
on; the rest is [#76](https://github.com/prasadtalasila/chitragupta/issues/76).

### Cheap: a stub corpus

The turn structure of a genre skill is independent of how big the corpus
is. A synthetic bibliography of five to ten short PDFs syncs in seconds
and exercises every phase: six interviewers still get dispatched, Phase 3
still builds a map, Phase 5 still writes sections, the gate still runs.
What changes is the *content* of each packet, not the count of them or
the number of turns they are resident for.

That makes a stub corpus the right vehicle for the A/B that matters --
the same topic, the same depth, once with packets pasted into dispatch
prompts and once with a file reference -- because it is the one
comparison where the difference is the change rather than the topic. Note
what the two arms now are: since 3.10.0 the shipped skill *is* the file
reference, so the paste arm means checking out the 3.9.0 revision of
`.claude/skills/deep-research/SKILL.md`, not editing the current one.
[The dispatch payload, measured on real material](#the-dispatch-payload-measured-on-real-material)
below is the cheaper half of that comparison, already done.

Its limit is the honest one: a stub corpus tells you what the *structure*
costs, not what a real run costs. Packet sizes on five toy papers are not
packet sizes on 501.

### Free, and needs no run at all: count the turns

The second factor in `bytes x turns` can be read off the skill file. Take
`.claude/skills/deep-research/SKILL.md`, count the mandated steps after
Phase 2 -- each named command, each dispatch, each dossier write, each
render -- and you have a floor on the multiplier that no topic can change.
Do the same for `survey-writer` after step 1. This is how the "~20 turns"
and "~22 turns" in the examples above were obtained, and it is the part
of the estimate least likely to be wrong, because it is a property of a
file in this repository rather than of a model's behaviour.

The first factor, packet size, can be bounded the same way: take one real
packet from any previous run's transcript, count its characters, divide
by four. No new run required.

### Already instrumented: `retrieval.md`

`python -m src.draft retrieve ... --log <draft>` appends one row per call --
mode, query, `k`, results, characters -- to the dossier's `retrieval.md`,
and `python -m src.draft dossier status` totals it. That is characters rather
than tokens and covers retrieval only, but it is the one number this
repository already collects on a real corpus, it is comparable between
runs, and it costs nothing beyond passing a flag.

The gap it leaves is exactly the one this document is about: it measures
what entered context, and not how many turns it stayed there for.

### The dispatch payload, measured on real material

The one number here that is counted rather than estimated. It is a
**character count of a payload**, not a token count of a run: the same
unit `retrieval.md` already collects, and the same reason -- characters
are countable without a model in the loop.

Method: the shipped example report
(`content/drafts/digital-twins-for-software-engineers/deep-research.md`,
7 sections, 11 distinct citekeys) with a dossier built from its own
citations -- `sections.md` from the citekeys each section actually cites,
and one `evidence.md` block per citekey whose `support:` line is a real
600-character evidence window pulled from the 501-paper corpus, i.e. the
same `src.draft retrieve evidence` call an interviewer makes. Then, per
section, `dossier brief --section` on one side and the dispatch line that
replaces it on the other.

| | Characters |
|---|---|
| Evidence a Phase 5 dispatch would have pasted, all sections | **15,660** |
| Dispatch lines that replace it (`Your evidence: python -m src.draft dossier brief ... --section "..."`) | **901** |
| Ratio | **17.4x** |

At the documented conversions -- four characters per token, output at 5x
a base input token -- that is an estimated 3,915 output tokens against
225, or **~19.6k input-token equivalents against ~1.1k**. It brackets the
15k estimate derived above rather than contradicting it, from the high
side: this report's blocks carry a 600-character window each, where the
estimate assumed ~800 tokens of packet-derived material per writer across
four writers.

Two sections contributed nothing, and they are the honest kind of zero:
"Perspectives assembled" and "Self peer review" cite nothing, so there
was never anything to paste for them. Reproduce it by building a dossier
the same way and diffing the two payloads; nothing about it needs a
drafting run.

What it does **not** measure: any effect on residency (there is none --
see [what the dossier actually recovers](#what-the-dossier-actually-recovers)),
and the turn counts either side of the change. Those still want the
before/after run in [#76](https://github.com/prasadtalasila/chitragupta/issues/76).

### The step 2a boundary, measured on real material

The other subagent boundary this document argues for --
[survey-writer step 2a](#the-one-lever-this-repository-does-not-own), the
one [Example 1](#example-1-one-rejected-paper-followed-to-the-end-of-the-run)
above derives a saving for from estimated figures (~150 tokens per result,
"3 kept per query, 12 rejected"). Measured here on real material, the
same way as the Phase 5 payload above: a real character count, not a
token count of a run.

Method: three sub-themes actually retrieved against the real 501-paper
corpus (`digital twin DevOps continuous integration`, `digital twin
runtime verification synchronization`, `digital twin security threat
model` -- a topic this corpus turns out to cover well, chosen for that
reason), `--k 15` each, `--log`ged to a scratch dossier. Every one of the
45 results read and judged by hand, exactly as `survey-writer` step 2
specifies -- kept into `evidence.md` with a `relevance:`/`support:` block,
turned down into `rejected.md` with a reason -- and both files measured
against the raw retrieval payload `retrieval.md` already recorded.

| | Characters |
|---|---|
| Raw candidate snippets, all 3 sub-themes (`retrieval.md`'s own `chars` total) | **22,280** |
| Judged packet a step 2a subagent returns instead (20 kept + 24 rejected) | **9,084** |
| Ratio | **2.45x** |

Smaller than Phase 5's 17.4x, and the reason is structural rather than a
measurement discrepancy: Phase 5's `brief` replaces detailed evidence with
a one-line file reference, discarding nearly all of the payload from the
orchestrator's side. Step 2a's boundary discards nothing -- the packet
still carries a `relevance:`/`support:` pair for every kept citekey and a
reason for every rejected one, the full judgment, restructured
rather than thrown away. Rejecting harder wouldn't close the gap either,
per Example 1's own point: the tokens are spent at retrieval regardless
of what survives judging.

**This run kept 20 of 45 (44%); Example 1 assumed 3 kept per query, 9 of
45 (20%).** The 2.45x ratio above moves directly with that keep rate --
one reader's judgment on one topic, on a sub-theme set chosen because
this corpus covers it unusually well. A stricter keeper, or a
thinner-covered topic, would reject more and push the ratio up. Treat
2.45x as this run's number, not a property of the boundary in general.

**Reconciled against Example 1, on the same slice of material.** Example
1 costs only the rejected share (5.4k of estimated tokens) and its own
text says "only the kept evidence comes back" -- then charges nothing for
that return trip, so its with-boundary total (6.8k, against 17.6k, a
~61% saving) is the subagent's one-time read and nothing past it. Redone
on the *measured* rejected share here -- 24 of 45 candidates, so
24/45 of the raw payload (2,971 tokens), and `rejected.md`'s own body
(952 tokens) -- at Example 1's exact method first, to check the two are
actually comparable:

| | Input-token equivalents (Example 1's method) |
|---|---|
| No boundary | 3,714 + 5,942 = **9,656** |
| With boundary (subagent's one-time read only, as Example 1 counts it) | **3,714** |
| Saving | **61.5%** |

That reproduces Example 1's ~61% almost exactly on real material, which
is the useful check: the method is internally consistent, and the gap
between the estimate and this run is measurement noise, not a modelling
error. **Then add the cost Example 1's text describes but its total
omits** -- the rejected list re-entering the orchestrator's context, once
at 1.25x and resident for the same ~20 turns as everything else it holds:

| | Input-token equivalents (rejected list costed both ways) |
|---|---|
| With boundary, subagent read + `rejected.md` write-back | 3,714 + 1,190 + 1,904 = **6,808** |
| Saving, corrected | **29.5%**, not 61.5% |

The boundary still wins on this slice -- discarding the raw candidates
inside a subagent instead of holding them resident for 20 turns is real
-- but the earlier ~61% counted the win and not its cost. Example 1 is
left as written rather than edited, since it is explicitly a worked
derivation of the *method* and this is the reconciliation, not a
retraction.

**The whole-payload figure -- kept and rejected together, which Example 1
never computed -- is a different, broader number, not a comparison to
Example 1's:**

| | Input-token equivalents (kept + rejected together) |
|---|---|
| No boundary: full raw payload enters once, resident 20 turns | 5,570 x 1.25 + 5,570 x 0.1 x 20 = **18,103** |
| With boundary: subagent's one-time read + full judged packet (kept + rejected) enters once, resident 20 turns | 5,570 x 1.25 + 2,271 x 1.25 + 2,271 x 0.1 x 20 = **14,343** |
| Saving | **21%** |

Lower than the rejects-only 29.5%, because the kept evidence was always
going to enter the orchestrator's context eventually -- it is what gets
cited -- so folding it into "cost avoided by the boundary" overstates the
boundary's own contribution. The rejects-only figure above is the fairer
one to compare against Example 1; this one is the fairer one to compare
against "what does step 2a save on this run's whole payload."

Reproduce it: run the three searches above with `--log` against a synced
corpus, judge every result the way `survey-writer` step 2 describes, and
diff `retrieval.md`'s total against `evidence.md` + `rejected.md`.
Nothing about it needs a full drafting run -- retrieval, judging, and
`dossier status` are the whole cost, and the judging is the same reading
a real drafting session would do regardless of which arm it measures.

What it does **not** measure: whether **the second, un-run arm** -- an
orchestrator running steps 1-2 inline, with no subagent at all -- differs
from this in any way other than where the read happens. It shouldn't, by
construction: the same 45 candidates get read and judged either way, so
the raw-payload row above already *is* that arm's cost, measured rather
than run twice. What a second run would add is confirming the turn count
doesn't itself change with the boundary removed (plausible, since
`survey-writer`'s numbered steps are unchanged either way, but unmeasured
here) -- the last piece [#76](https://github.com/prasadtalasila/chitragupta/issues/76)
still owns.

## Measured, derived, and asserted

Kept separate on purpose, in a project where
[PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md) means measured.

**Measured** -- four figures now, in two different units. The 35 turns /
1,991,974 input / 14,318 output above, from this session's own
transcript, on the machine this was written on: it demonstrates the
ratio, and is not a benchmark of a drafting run. The [199/268
orchestrator turns against 93/69 subagent
turns](#free-the-session-transcript-already-has-the-answer) from two of
this machine's own multi-agent sessions, after the transcript recipe's
subagent-file bug was fixed -- ordinary engineering work, not a drafting
run either. The
[15,660 against 901 characters](#the-dispatch-payload-measured-on-real-material)
of Phase 5 dispatch payload, counted on the shipped example report
against the real corpus: a payload size, not a run. And the [22,280
against 9,084 characters](#the-step-2a-boundary-measured-on-real-material)
of the step 2a boundary, from a real 3-sub-theme, 45-candidate retrieval
pass against the real corpus, judged by hand: also a payload size, not a
run -- and the one figure here that corrects an earlier derived estimate
(Example 1's implied ~61% saving) rather than only confirming one.

**Derived** -- the turn counts (read off the skill files), the pricing
multipliers (structural ratios of the Claude API, not prices), and every
worked example built from them.

**Estimated** -- every token count of a payload: ~150 per
`SearchResult`, ~1k per interview packet, ~4.6k to write an 18.3 KB
draft. All from file sizes and documented defaults, at four characters
per token.

**Asserted** -- that the orchestrator's context is append-only between
compactions, that a subagent's is discarded on return, and the
[`CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` resolution order](#the-one-lever-this-repository-does-not-own)
together with the `inherit` frontmatter default. These are
properties of the harness rather than of this repository, and everything
in ["What the dossier actually recovers"](#what-the-dossier-actually-recovers)
depends on them. If a future harness evicts old tool results, the
residency argument weakens and the dispatch-prompt argument does not.
