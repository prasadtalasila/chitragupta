# Performance

Status: **measurements.** Written 2026-08-03.

**Written for** anyone choosing settings on their own hardware and
wanting the measured cost rather than a guess. **Assumed:**
[CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md) for what each setting does. **Not covered here:**
the parallelism design behind these numbers, which is
[PARALLELISM.md](PARALLELISM.md), written for someone changing it.

What each setting in [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md) costs, measured rather than
estimated. [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md) says what a setting *does* and what
values it takes; this says what it *costs*, so neither document has to
carry both jobs.

## Read the numbers with the machine in mind

**Every figure below is one machine's, and yours will differ.** They are
here to give you ratios and orders of magnitude -- "OCR roughly halves
throughput", "the parse is CPU-bound, not GPU-bound" -- not absolute
times to plan against. Where a figure only makes sense against the
hardware, the hardware is named.

Two reference machines are used throughout. This is their full
specification; [README.md](../README.md#hardware-requirements) has the
sizing guidance that follows from it.

| Name used below | What it is |
|---|---|
| **the small machine** | 4 cores, 9.7 GB RAM (~3 GB actually free), no GPU |
| **the multi-GPU machine** | 96 logical cores (48 available to the process), 251 GB RAM, 4x NVIDIA A40 46 GB, driver 555.42.02, CUDA 12.5. Verified 2026-07-30 |

The corpus is this project's own bibliography: **501 PDFs, 13,400 pages,
1.54 GB**, median 16 pages, with one 675-page book that is 5% of all
pages by itself. Software: docling 2.117.0, torch 2.7.1+cu126,
Python 3.12.3.

Reproduce any of it with the harness in `bench/` -- see `bench/README.md`.

## Install-time costs and traps

Two costs land before any setting below matters, and both are paid at
install time. Neither is a knob you tune -- they are the two ways the
install comes out wrong.

**No GPU, disk tight -- several GB of CUDA you will never use.**
`pip`/Poetry's default torch wheel pulls a full set of `nvidia-*` CUDA
packages whether or not a GPU is present. That is most of what makes the
venv 6.0 GB. On a CPU-only host, install torch from the CPU-only wheel
index *before* running the installer:

```bash
.venv-full/bin/pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
bash scripts/install_full_pipeline.sh python-deps
```

**GPU present, but `torch.cuda.is_available()` is `False` -- silently
CPU-only.** This is the failure mode that costs the entire 4.70x below
while looking like a working install. `scripts/install_full_pipeline.sh`'s
`ensure_gpu_torch` exists to catch it: it reads the driver's supported
CUDA ceiling from `nvidia-smi` and reinstalls torch from a matching
CUDA-tagged wheel index. It runs on every `python-deps`/`dev-deps` install,
is idempotent, and is safe to re-run by hand. Check with:

```bash
.venv-full/bin/python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__, torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

It was verified end to end on the multi-GPU machine, whose driver caps at
CUDA 12.5 while the Poetry-resolved wheel wanted CUDA 13 -- exactly the
mismatch that runs CPU-only without complaining. If it still reports
`False` after a `python-deps` install, the driver may predate every wheel
tag the script knows; that function's own comments have the manual
fallback.

## `[parser].backend` -- pdftotext or docling

Measured on 5 real bibliography PDFs, cold (no caching -- `pdf_text.py`
does not cache, so these are extraction times, not `sync`'s steady state,
which skips PDFs whose bytes have not changed).

| Backend | Total, 5 PDFs | Words extracted | Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pdftotext` | 1.43s | 68,888 | 1x |
| `docling` (OCR on, i.e. before OCR defaulted off) | 60.77s | 69,565 | ~42x |

Per document the ratio ranged **~18x-102x**, tracking document length
loosely at best -- so budget against the total, not the best case.

**Fidelity is close.** docling's word counts stay within ~3.5% of
`pdftotext`'s on every one of the five. The reason to pick docling is
structure (reading order, sections, tables), not word recovery -- and the
reason to pick `pdftotext` is speed plus page boundaries, which docling's
output does not have. [PDF-PARSER.md](PDF-PARSER.md) has the full
comparison, including the two backends that were evaluated and removed.

That ~42x figure is enough to choose a backend and useless for planning a
run, which is what the rest of this document is for.

## `[parser].ocr` -- the largest single lever, and a trade

**OCR's cost is not a single number.** It grows with worker count,
because OCR is CPU-bound and therefore competes with the parallelism you
added. Measured 2026-08-04, end to end over the whole 501-PDF corpus:

| Workers | OCR off | OCR on | Cost of OCR |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3330.4s | 6941.4s | **2.08x** |
| 12 | 310.2s | 1213.9s | **3.91x** |
| 24 | 237.6s | 1139.0s | **4.79x** |

Equivalently, from the other side -- **turning OCR on roughly halves how
well the pipeline parallelises**:

| | Speedup, 1 -> 24 workers |
|---|---|
| OCR off | 14.02x |
| OCR on | **6.09x** |

At 24 workers with OCR on, 93% of the available CPU is busy -- the one
configuration measured where this machine is genuinely full. docling's
OCR runs on the CPU (RapidOCR on onnxruntime), which is why.

**And it cannot be moved to the GPU by configuration alone**, which is
worth knowing before you go looking for the setting. Two things are in the
way, either of which is enough on its own:

- The `onnxruntime` wheel this project installs is the CPU build.
  `onnxruntime.get_available_providers()` returns
  `['AzureExecutionProvider', 'CPUExecutionProvider']` -- no
  `CUDAExecutionProvider` to select.
- docling's `RapidOcrModel` sets `use_cuda` on the *paddle* and *torch*
  engine configs but not on the onnxruntime one, so the default backend
  never asks for CUDA even where it is available.

So `[parser].ocr = true` is a CPU cost that the `device` a worker is given
does not touch. Measured here on one PDF, one worker, `cuda:0`: **5.31s
with OCR on against 1.13s with it off** -- OCR is 79% of the wall clock,
all of it on the CPU.

That 79% is also the size of the prize, and it is not small. Getting OCR
onto a card would mean `RapidOcrOptions(backend="torch")` -- the one
backend docling wires `use_cuda` into -- plus a config key to select it.
Do not size that work against the 1.79x above: that figure is what the
GPU is worth *while OCR stays on the CPU*, not a ceiling on moving OCR
itself. The stages that already run on a GPU go 4.70x faster there
(above), and OCR is the larger share of an OCR-enabled run, so the
plausible gain is a good deal more than 1.79x. Measure it before
believing any particular number, including this reasoning.

An earlier figure of **2.46x** appears in older documents and in
`bench/RESULTS.md`. It came from a 16-PDF serial sample and is a
reasonable estimate of the *serial* cost (measured: 2.08x); it is not the
cost you will pay on a parallel run.

**It is not free, and this is the part to read twice.** OCR only runs on
*bitmap* regions, so what it recovers is text stored in the PDF as an
image rather than as characters. Turning it off changed the extracted
text of **8 of those 16 documents**:

- Mostly publisher furniture (`IEEEAccess`, `DTU Library`) and figure
  sub-captions. Losing that is an improvement.
- But one document lost **10.1% of its characters**, including two
  complete tables embedded as images, and another lost a paragraph of
  body prose set in a graphical text box.

So `false` suits born-digital papers. Set `true` for scans, since with
OCR off docling extracts almost nothing from one, or where
tables-as-images matter more than parse time. **The parse-quality guard
will not catch a wrong choice here**: it looks for run-together words,
not for content that never arrived.

## GPU vs CPU -- it depends entirely on OCR

**With OCR on, 1.79x:**

| | s/page | Extrapolated to the corpus |
|---|---|---|
| One process, one GPU, OCR on | 0.43 | ~1.6 hours |
| One process, CPU only, OCR on | 1.37 | ~5.1 hours |
| Like for like, same 6 PDFs | | **1.79x** |

During that run the GPU averaged **~7% SM utilisation** and 1.7 GB of
46 GB, while the process held ~300% CPU -- three of the 48 available
cores.

**With OCR off -- the default -- 4.70x**, measured 2026-08-05 over 100
documents / 2,529 pages, serial, one process, converters warmed so model
loading is excluded, the same PDFs through both devices:

| Documents | Pages | GPU | CPU | Aggregate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | 75 | 0.222 s/page | 0.975 s/page | 4.39x |
| 25 | 394 | 0.174 s/page | 0.948 s/page | 5.43x |
| 50 | 798 | 0.211 s/page | 0.985 s/page | 4.67x |
| **100** | **2,529** | **0.205 s/page** | **0.965 s/page** | **4.70x** |

Per document: median 4.31x, quartiles 3.46x and 6.56x, range 1.74x to
17.35x. Only one document of the hundred came in under 2x. The benefit
grows with document size -- 3.49x aggregate under 10 pages against 5.78x
at 30 pages or more -- because layout and table inference are the stages
that scale with page count while the fixed per-document costs do not.

**The two figures are not in conflict, and the difference is the point.**
OCR runs on the CPU either way, so it adds the same seconds to *both*
sides of the comparison and drags the ratio toward 1. It is not that the
GPU does less when OCR is on; it is that the run contains much more work
the GPU cannot touch. Read 1.79x as "what a GPU is worth on an OCR run"
and 4.70x as "what it is worth on a default run" -- and note that the
default is the one most people will measure.

docling is still CPU-bound overall (PDF backend, layout post-processing,
and OCR when enabled), one worker still leaves ~93% of a card idle, and
the numbers below are still why the parallelism work went after CPU-level
document concurrency first. A GPU is worth having; it is not what makes
a corpus parse fast.

## `[parser].workers` -- document-level parallelism

**The largest lever on a multi-core machine, and the code currently caps
it well below where the curve flattens.**

Measured 2026-08-04 with the real `python -m chitragupta.corpus sync` over the **whole
501-PDF corpus** (13,400 pages), docling, OCR off, 4 GPUs. Each row is
one run from an empty ledger; all reported 501 parsed, 0 failed:

| Workers | Wall clock | Speedup | Efficiency | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3330.4s | 1.00x | -- | |
| 4 | 799.2s | 4.17x | 104% | |
| 8 | 428.6s | 7.77x | 97% | |
| 12 | 310.2s | 10.74x | 89% | <- **the most `worker_ceiling()` allows** |
| 16 | 268.1s | 12.42x | 78% | |
| 24 | 235.0s | 14.17x | 59% | median of 3 |
| **32** | **223.4s** | **14.91x** | 47% | median of 3 |
| 48 | 221.4s | 15.04x | 31% | median of 3 |

- **Scaling holds far better than previously documented.** 97% at 8
  workers, 89% at 12. The 104% at 4 is not an error: one worker does not
  saturate the threads it is given, so serial is a slightly unfair
  denominator.
- **The knee is somewhere past 24, not at 12.** `worker_ceiling()` caps
  at `allowed_cpus // 4`, which is 12 here. Running 32 is **~1.4x
  faster** -- available today only by changing that constant.
- **The curve plateaus from 32 to 48; it does not reverse.** Medians of
  three runs put them 0.9% apart (223.4s vs 221.4s), while the spread
  *within* the 32-worker configuration alone was 86.8s. An earlier
  single-run pass had 32 beating 48 and read that as a knee; with repeats
  the ordering flips. **Anything past ~32 is flat, and single runs cannot
  resolve it.**
- So the useful statement is "the divisor should be much smaller than 4",
  not "it should be 1.5". Any specific value here is arithmetic from
  **one machine and one corpus**, on a plateau, and a CPU-only machine
  would likely want a different one.
- Asking for 16 on this machine resolves to 12 and takes 315.9s. The
  clamp is doing exactly what it documents, and costing 1.43x.

**Why the cap is too low:** the constant models a worker as occupying 4
CPUs. It does not. Measured CPU busy, against the 48 available:

| Run | CPUs busy | of the 48 allowed |
|---|---|---|
| 16 workers | 18.7 | 39% |
| 32 workers | ~34 | ~70% |
| 24 workers, OCR on | 44.6 | **93%** |

At 32 workers -- well past the point the code will go -- the CPU is still
only ~70% busy. With OCR off a worker uses closer to one CPU than four.
(The 32-worker figure landed at 71% in one sweep and 70% in another; a
run-to-run point is worth about a percentage point, not a decimal.)

### What flattens the curve past ~24 workers

Timing each run's phases separates the candidates:

| Workers | Startup (to 1st document) | Tail (after last) | CPU busy |
|---|---|---|---|
| 24 | 18.6s — **7.9%** of the run | 4.9s — 2.1% | 56% |
| 32 | 21.8s — **8.9%** | 5.9s — 2.6% | 70% |
| 48 | 28.5s — **12.7%** | 7.9s — 3.6% | 78% |

- **Startup is a growing tax, not a fixed one.** Every worker pays its
  own ~8.5s model load, so standing the pool up costs more the bigger the
  pool: 7.9% of the run at 24 workers, 12.7% at 48. (The column is time
  to the *first completion*, so it also contains the fastest document's
  parse -- an upper bound on startup rather than a measurement of it.
  The **growth** is the startup part: one document's parse does not get
  slower because the pool got bigger.)
- **The CPU is heading for saturation**, 56% to 78% across the same
  range. Read alone, "70% busy at 32" suggests headroom; read against 56%
  at 24 and 78% at 48, it is *becoming* the limit.
- **The long-document tail is not the story** — 5-8s throughout, under 4%.

Neither cost alone explains the plateau; together they account for it,
and both worsen with every worker added.

**Corpus size still decides whether raising this is worth anything.** Over
8 documents, 4 workers gave 1.90x and 8 gave none at all -- 34.6s / 18.3s
/ 19.3s. Each worker pays its own ~8.5s model load, so the benefit is
proportional to how much work there is to amortise it over. That is why
the resolved count is also capped by the number of documents needing a
parse.

## Multi-GPU -- nothing to configure

With docling and more than one worker, each worker process claims one
CUDA device round-robin. This is not automatic in docling: its
`AcceleratorDevice.AUTO` resolves to `cuda:0` in *every* process, so
without an explicit per-worker device every worker piles onto card 0
while the rest idle.

Measured over the whole 501-PDF corpus (2026-08-04, OCR off):

| Workers | 1 GPU | 2 GPUs | 4 GPUs | 1->2 | 2->4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 12 | 518.4s | 339.7s | 310.2s | 1.53x | 1.10x |
| 24 | 535.8s | 298.6s | 237.6s | **1.79x** | 1.26x |

- **The second card is worth far more than the third and fourth.**
- **GPUs matter more at higher worker counts**, since more workers share
  each card.
- At 24 workers, one GPU is *slower* than at 12 (535.8s vs 518.4s):
  piling more workers onto a single card is counterproductive.

The 2026-08-02 run of the same 12-worker configuration measured 528.0s
and 326.2s -- within 2-5% of the figures above, on a different day and a
rebuilt venv.

Restrict which cards are used with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`; there is no
separate setting, and the pool only ever sees what that leaves visible.

**And it is worth nothing on a small corpus.** The same change measured
over a 60-document subset showed no difference at all (122.4s at 4
workers, 123.0s at 12), with all four GPUs busy and the CPU ~85% idle.
Per-worker startup dominates at that size.

## `[parser].start_method` -- per-worker startup

A cold docling worker needs about **8.5s** before it produces its first
page on the multi-GPU machine:

| Stage | Time |
|---|---|
| `import torch` | 1.16s |
| `import docling` | 2.08s |
| Build the `DocumentConverter` | 0.13s |
| First `convert()` -- docling loads its models here | 5.17s |
| **Total before the first parsed page** | **8.5s** |
| A later `convert()`, models warm | 0.33s |

Only the ~3.2s of imports can be shared between processes; the ~5s model
load lives on the converter instance, in whichever process built it. So
`forkserver` -- which imports torch and docling once in a helper process
that every worker is forked from -- can address at most that 3.2s.

**And sharing the import, on its own, is worth nothing.** Workers import
concurrently, so on a host with spare CPUs that cost was already
overlapped. Measured head to head over 8 documents at 4 workers:
`spawn` 22.9s, `forkserver` 22.4s.

The saving is in *when* the preload runs. `sync` starts the forkserver
before reading the bibliography, so the import happens during the ~2.5s
that takes rather than blocking pool construction afterwards -- four live
workers ready at **4.40s instead of 6.90s**.

End to end on the real `sync`, medians of three runs, fresh output
directory each time:

| Documents | Workers | `spawn` | `forkserver` | Saving |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | 1 (serial) | 46.2s | -- | -- |
| 8 | 4 | 23.1s | **21.8s** | 1.3s (5.6%) |
| 8 | 8 | 22.9s | **20.7s** | 2.2s (9.6%) |
| 60 | 1 (serial) | 383.2s | -- | -- |
| 60 | 4 | 103.6s | **101.9s** | 1.7s (1.6%) |
| 60 | 12 | 80.8s | **78.8s** | 2.0s (2.5%) |

Run-to-run spread was 0.3-1.0s, so the effect clears the noise
everywhere -- and it is the *same* effect everywhere: a roughly constant
1.3-2.2s off pool startup. What changes is how much of the run that is:
9.6% of an 8-document run, 2.5% of a 60-document one, well under 1% of
the full corpus.

**So this does not make a bulk parse meaningfully faster, and was never
going to.** It helps the case where startup *is* the run: a handful of
documents.

## `[parser].document_timeout` -- what a safe value looks like

Not a performance knob so much as a knob whose value has to be *chosen
from* performance. Any threshold has to clear the slowest document you
legitimately have. In this corpus that is a 675-page book which takes
**246s** on its own, so a value that is safe here may not be safe on a
corpus with a longer document. Measure before setting it.

`[parser].stall_timeout`'s 1800s default is 7x that figure, chosen loose
on purpose: it is meant to catch a run that will never finish, not to
police a slow one.

## `[enrich].docling_images` -- disk, and a full re-parse

Two costs, both worth knowing before turning it on:

- **It invalidates the whole docling cache**, so the next run re-parses
  every PDF from scratch. That re-parse is the point rather than a bug --
  the existing `.md` files genuinely have no figure references in them.
- **The PNGs are real disk**: a 17-page paper produced 13 of them.
  `docling_image_scale = 2.0` is roughly 144 DPI, enough to read a figure
  back without storing print-resolution files.

## `[source_pdfs] dir` -- retired

Nothing left to measure: the enrichment corpus is now the bibliography
alone, so there is no second source to deduplicate against. A config file
still naming the key is ignored. `chitragupta/enrich/corpus.py` has the reasoning,
and the retired duplicate-check timings stand in `bench/RESULTS.md`.

## Where it all ended up

Measured end to end on 2026-08-04, rather than extrapolated:

| Change | Kind | Full 501-PDF corpus |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline: serial, OCR on | -- | **1h 56m** |
| OCR off | not parallelism | 55m 30s |
| 12 workers, 4 GPUs (today's cap) | CPU + GPU | 5m 10s |
| 32 workers, 4 GPUs (needs the clamp raised) | CPU | **3m 43s** |

**22x with the shipped defaults, 31x with the clamp raised.** Earlier
editions of this table read `~1.6 h -> ~39 min -> 8.8 min -> 5m26s`; the
first two were extrapolations that ran low, so the improvement was
understated.

**22x with the shipped defaults, and the GPU work is the smallest
contribution.** The largest is a boolean.
[PARALLELISM.md](PARALLELISM.md) describes the machinery that produces
these numbers; `bench/RESULTS.md` carries the measurements themselves,
including the conclusions later ones overturned.

## What a drift sweep costs

Everything above is the corpus layer: `sync` and the enrichment stages,
where a run is measured in minutes. `python -m chitragupta.draft dossier status
--all` sits in the drafting layer and is measured in seconds. It is worth
pricing here for one reason: it is meant to be run **after every sync**,
so "cheap enough to be habitual" is a requirement rather than a
nicety.

The sweep builds a BM25 index in memory and discards it, rather than
calling `chitragupta.retrieval.search()` -- which would take a write connection
to the ledger and rewrite `content/retrieval_index.json` every time an
inspection ran. [DRAFT-ITERATION.md](DRAFT-ITERATION.md#why-the-new-papers-are-not-found-with-search)
is the argument; this is the price.

Multi-GPU machine, bare `python` (no venv -- `chitragupta.dossier` is
stdlib-only), no GPU involved. Medians of 5 runs over this project's own
corpus: 646 ledger rows, 47.4 MB of parsed text. The drift scan never
opens a PDF, so what it costs depends on the parsed text and the row
count, not on the PDFs behind them.

| Dossiers swept | Cold (no index cache) | Warm (cache from a prior `search()`) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2.032s | 0.218s |
| 10 | 2.036s | 0.257s |
| 50 | 2.227s | 0.436s |

**Fifty dossiers cost 0.19s more than one.** The corpus tokenization is
paid once for the whole sweep, not once per dossier -- at ~4ms marginal
cost each, the sweep is dominated by corpus size and effectively
indifferent to how many drafts you have. Dossiers that logged no
retrieval queries never build an index at all: 0.040s for 50.

That marginal cost is measured **within** a run, where the two numbers
share a process and a page cache. Cold time drifts ~5% between runs, so
differencing two separate runs of this table would not reproduce it;
three runs each produce a paired delta of 0.19-0.24s. `bench/RESULTS.md`
has the spread.

Cold cost is linear in corpus size (a generated 2000-document corpus:
5.857s), and a warm cache is 5.1-9.3x faster than a cold one. So the
honest summary is not "free" but **"about two seconds after a sync, and
it does not grow with your drafts"**. `bench/RESULTS.md` has the full
run, the synthetic scaling cross-check, and what the measurement
excludes.

## What raising the worker count costs in reproducibility

Worth pricing alongside the speedups above, because it is the one cost of
parallelism not measured in seconds: **the more workers, the less
reproducible the parse.** Docling groups dense reference blocks into
elements differently under contention. That changes both the parsed text
and the passage spans quoted from it.

At the scale this matters: comparing runs over all 501 documents, ~1.4%
of documents come back with different text and ~1.0% with a different
quotable passage. Two runs of the *same* configuration are not exempt, at
roughly a third of that rate. Serial parsing has not been observed to
vary.

**The full contract is
[ARCHITECTURE.md's "What is reproducible, and what is not"](ARCHITECTURE.md#what-is-reproducible-and-what-is-not)**,
artifact by artifact, and `bench/RESULTS.md`'s 2026-08-07 section has the
measurement. Both are stated once, there.

Two corrections to figures that once stood in this document, kept
because the retracted versions were quoted elsewhere. The earlier "6
files differ, under 0.06%" understated the effect by counting bytes
rather than passages. And "repeating a run at the same worker count
reproduces exactly" is **false**: 5 of 572 same-configuration
comparisons differ in bytes, and 2 in passage text.
