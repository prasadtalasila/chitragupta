# 🏷 Chitragupta

Status: **reference.** Written 2026-08-05. Updated 2026-08-23.

A divine record keeper who keeps the ledger of deeds and audits souls against it.

## 🪶 The figure

Chitragupta is the registrar of the Hindu cosmos: the deity who
maintains the complete record of every action of every being, from
birth to death. When a soul arrives in Yama's court, it is Chitragupta
who produces the account — not an impression or a summary, but the
itemized record, on the strength of which judgment is passed.

He is depicted holding a pen (*lekhani*), an inkpot, and the ledger
itself. His name is usually parsed as *chitra* + *gupta* — "the one in
whom all the records reside, kept safe."

## 💡 Why the name fits this project

This pipeline turns a curated BibTeX bibliography into grounded survey
papers, thesis chapters, and tutorial chapters, with every citation
mechanically verified against a ledger of real, parsed PDFs. Its one
hard invariant is that a citekey is never fabricated. The
correspondence with Chitragupta is point-for-point rather than a loose
theme:

1. **The ledger is the whole identity.** Other knowledge deities
   preside over learning broadly; Chitragupta *is* his ledger. This
   project's center of gravity is `content/ledger.sqlite` — a
   complete, per-citekey record of what actually exists and what state
   it is in. The project shares his essential character, not just his
   domain.

2. **He records; he never composes.** Chitragupta's authority comes
   precisely from the fact that no entry in his book was invented.
   That is this project's hard invariant, stated almost verbatim in
   AGENTS.md: a citekey exists in the record only because a real parse
   of a real PDF put it there. The pipeline never invents a citekey
   and never renames one.

3. **Judgment happens against the record.** In Yama's court, claims
   about a life are checked against the book, and the book wins. That
   is `citation gate` exactly: a draft's claims are checked against
   the ledger at the moment of reckoning, and a `FAIL` is final — a
   gate, not a suggestion.

4. **The audit is incorruptible, not well-intentioned.** Chitragupta
   is characterized as impartial: the record cannot be argued with or
   flattered. This project's enforcement is likewise mechanical — a
   PostToolUse hook runs the gate on every write under
   `content/drafts/`, so grounding does not depend on anyone
   remembering to be honest. "Enforced mechanically, not by good
   intentions" (README) could be his epithet.

5. **Evidence, quoted.** Judgment in the stories is not a bare
   verdict; the deeds are read out. `citation_provenance` quoting the
   actual supporting passage from each cited source is the same move:
   the record does not just establish *that* a source exists, it can
   produce *what in it* supports the claim.
