"""Reads the BibTeX-exported .bib file -- the source of truth for
citekeys and bibliographic metadata (project decision, 2026-07-28).

No auto-sync plugin is installed, so this file is a manual, point-in-time
export from your reference manager, not continuously auto-synced --
re-export it after adding papers, then re-run `python -m src.corpus sync`.
Whatever citekey BibTeX assigns in this file IS the citekey everywhere
downstream (the ledger, citation_gate, generated drafts); this module
never invents its own.

Needs `bibtexparser` (pyproject.toml's main dependency group, installed
via scripts/install_full_pipeline.sh) -- the one dependency the
otherwise stdlib-only corpus layer requires, because hand-rolling a
correct BibTeX parser (nested braces, LaTeX escapes, multi-line values)
is a worse bet than using a maintained library for something
citation-critical.
