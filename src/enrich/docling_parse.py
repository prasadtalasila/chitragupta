"""Stage 1: Docling PDF parsing.

Layout-aware parsing (headings, tables, reading order) -- a step up from
the corpus layer's plain pdftotext. Needs `docling` from
pyproject.toml's "enrich" Poetry group, in a venv; bulky (its own
layout/OCR models), so this is the stage most likely to be slow or fail
on a small/CPU-only host. Output is Markdown, written per-doc so a
failure on one document doesn't lose progress on the others.

Not the same thing as `[parser].backend = "docling"`, and not made
redundant by it. That setting points src/pdf_text.py at the same library
to produce one .txt per citekey for BM25; this stage produces structured
Markdown plus the `<doc>.passages.json` sidecar for the whole corpus,
always, whatever that setting says.

What it no longer does is repeat work the corpus layer has already done.
When that setting *is* `docling`, `_reuse_corpus_parse` adopts the
existing parse for a citekey instead of converting the PDF a second time.
The dependency runs one way only, which is the way this package is
allowed to depend: the enrichment layer reads the corpus layer's
artefacts, and nothing in the corpus layer is shaped to make that
possible (see `_executor_for`'s docstring for the same rule applied to
imports).

With config.DOCLING_IMAGES on, each doc also gets its figure bitmaps
(in `<stem>_artifacts/`, written by Docling itself) and a
`<stem>.figures.json` index giving each figure's page, caption, and the
string to cite it by. Those images are a reading aid for checking a
draft against its sources -- never draft content, since citing a paper
grants no right to reproduce its figures. See DEVELOPER.md's "Figures
and copyright".

parse_corpus() is incremental: a per-citekey (size, mtime_ns) fingerprint
is cached to config.DOCLING_CACHE_PATH, so a PDF that's unchanged since
the last call skips straight past DocumentConverter -- the slowest stage
in this whole pipeline (373s for 5 PDFs, per DEVELOPER.md's own known-gaps
note this closes). Unlike src/ledger.py's stat-before-hash, there's no
sha256 fallback here: a same-size edit that also preserves mtime (e.g.
`cp --preserve=timestamps`) slips past this check and the .md stays
stale until something else invalidates the cache entry (deleting it, or
deleting the .md itself -- see below). That's a real gap, not a free
trade-off the way it is in ledger.py (there, hashing is the fallback
that stat merely defers); accepted here because Docling is opt-in
(`enrich.py --stages docling`, not part of `sync`) and a source
this stale-cache-prone is rare enough not to warrant sha256-hashing every
PDF up front just to guard against it. The cache also re-checks that the
expected output file still exists before trusting a fingerprint match,
so manually deleting a .md file forces a re-parse instead of leaving it
silently missing forever.

That fingerprint only sees the *input* PDF, though, so it cannot notice
a change to what this module writes. `_CACHE_VERSION` and the recorded
`config.DOCLING_IMAGES` and `config.PARSER_OCR` settings cover that
second axis: any one of them differing from the cache file invalidates
the whole cache rather than any single entry, since all three change
what every .md should contain.
