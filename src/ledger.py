"""SQLite ledger tracking per-citekey pipeline status.

The ledger lets `sync` be incremental: a paper is only re-parsed if its
PDF content actually changed, not on every run. Change detection is
two-stage: a cheap (size, mtime) stat comparison first, and a sha256
content hash only when that stat doesn't match what was last recorded
(or there's nothing recorded yet) -- see upsert_reference. This is the
state that makes the deterministic pipeline safe to run unattended/on a
schedule, including on a corpus large enough that re-hashing every PDF
on every no-op run would dominate the run's wall-clock time.
