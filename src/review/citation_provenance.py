"""Citation provenance report: for each citation in a draft, what in the
cited source supports it, and where.

`citation_gate` answers "is this citekey real?" -- exactly, as a hard
gate. This answers the question that comes next and can't be answered
exactly: *does the cited paper actually say this?* A claim that drifted
away from its source during drafting passes the gate cleanly, because
the citekey is real; only reading the source catches it.

One of the three commands in the **review layer**, with
src/review/citation_coverage.py and src/review/verbatim_check.py -- run by hand on
a finished draft, never automatically, never a gate, and never holding
the write lock. src/review/__init__.py owns what the three have in common: where
the report goes (`content/review/`, mirroring the draft's path) and what
its header looks like.

Not a gate, and for a concrete reason. Matching is lexical, so it cannot separate "the source
doesn't say this" from "the source says it in words I didn't recognise".
A check that blocked on that distinction would train people to work
around it, which is exactly the corrosion citation_gate avoids by only
ever asserting something it can verify exactly.

Passages come from `src/passages.py`, which owns the sidecar -> pages ->
`pdftotext` ladder and the rule that a source with no reading order
reports a page rather than a quotation. This module scores claims
against whatever that ladder hands back; it no longer decides where the
text comes from.

Stdlib only (sqlite3/re), like citation_gate.py and references.py --
runs with bare `python3`, no venv.

Usage:
    python3 -m src.review provenance content/drafts/<slug>.md
    python3 -m src.review provenance <draft.md> --formats md,tex,pdf

    the weak one.

    So the unit is the block (`_claim_spans`), then the sentence within it

    blank-line paragraph containing no sentence boundary at all: reading
