"""Deterministic pipeline entrypoint: bib file -> ledger -> parsed text.

Safe to run unattended / on a schedule (idempotent, incremental):
    python -m src.sync

A citekey that drops out of the bib file is only *reported* by default --
pass --remove-stale to actually delete its content/ledger.sqlite row (see
"Removing a paper" in README.md and src/ledger.py's find_stale/prune_missing).

This is the corpus layer: no generation, no LLM calls, just
bringing the shared corpus layer up to date with the bibliography (see
src/bib_reader.py -- the BibTeX-exported .bib file is the source of
truth for citekeys, not something this pipeline generates). Genre-specific
drafting (the drafting layer) is invoked separately, on demand, via the
Claude Code
skills in .claude/skills/.

Needs `bibtexparser` installed -- run scripts/install_full_pipeline.sh
first (creates .venv-full/ on a bare host), then run this via that
venv's python. python -m src.draft gate does not need it and still
runs with the bare system interpreter.

    The two backends want opposite things, so this is deliberately
    backend-conditional rather than one pool type for both. `pdftotext`
    is an external subprocess that releases the GIL while it runs, so a
    ThreadPoolExecutor already gets full OS-level concurrency and a
    process pool would only add pickling and spawn cost on top. `docling`
    runs in-process and holds the GIL, so threads would serialise exactly
    the work we are trying to overlap.

    The docling pool also claims one GPU per worker. Docling's
    `AcceleratorDevice.AUTO` resolves to `cuda:0` in *every* process, so
    without this every worker contends for one card while the rest of the
    machine's GPUs idle -- measured at 12 workers: GPU 0 pinned at 100%,
    GPUs 1-3 at 0%, and no faster than 4 workers. The index is handed out
    by a shared counter under a lock, because a pool creates its workers
    lazily and numbers none of them.

    The start method is pdf_text.process_pool_context's to choose --
    forkserver where it exists, so torch and docling are imported once
    for the whole pool rather than once per worker, and spawn otherwise.
    Never plain fork: this process holds the run lock and the ledger open
    as live sqlite connections, which must not be inherited.

    its work in a child interpreter, where the test process's
