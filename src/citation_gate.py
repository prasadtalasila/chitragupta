"""Citation verification gate.

Every genre skill (survey/thesis-chapter/textbook-chapter/tutorial) MUST run this
against its own output before presenting a draft as finished. It is a
hard gate, not advisory: a citekey that doesn't resolve to something
`sync` actually pulled from the bib file is treated as fabricated and
blocks the draft.

This is not a hypothetical concern -- papers/DT-Simulation-Patterns/main.bib
in this same environment already contains entries a prior review marked
"WARNING: UNVERIFIABLE" (fabricated placeholders). A generative writer
must never be allowed to invent a citekey; it may only cite what is in
the ledger.

Usage:
    python -m src.draft gate <file> [<file> ...]

Recognizes any LaTeX/biblatex/natbib command whose name contains "cite"
(\\cite, \\citep, \\citealp, \\footcite, \\nocite, capitalized biblatex
forms, ..., with optional * and [] options) and Pandoc/Markdown ([@key],
[@key1; @key2], bare @key, suppressed-author -@key) citation syntax. Code
fences, inline code spans, and LaTeX verbatim/lstlisting/minted
environments are excluded from scanning first (see _blank_code).

# Matches the command name by substring ("contains cite/Cite") rather than
# an explicit list of the standard cite/citep/citet/... names -- an earlier,
# enumerated version of this regex silently missed \citealp, \citealt,
# \footcite, \smartcite, \fullcite, \nocite, \citenum, \citeyearpar, and
# every capitalized biblatex form (\Citep, \Textcite, ...): ordered
# alternation tries "cite" first, matches as a prefix of "citealp", then
# fails to find the "{" that must immediately follow and never backs off to
# try the longer alternatives. That's a false negative on the invariant
# this gate exists to enforce (a fabricated key in an unrecognized command
# reads as "0 citations" instead of "unresolved"), so err toward matching
# too much (a stray "\path{cite-me}"-shaped command) over too little.
# _WS (not bare \s*) before the star, each [...] option group, and the
# final {...}: TeX itself skips whitespace between a control word and its
# arguments, so `\citep {key}` and `\citep\n{key}` are both valid and
# equivalent to `\citep{key}` -- without this, either would silently miss
# a real (or fabricated) citekey, the same false-negative class the rest
# of this regex already exists to close. Capped at a single optional
# newline rather than bare \s* for two independent reasons that both land
# on the same fix: (1) a blank line is \par in TeX, which is NOT
# skippable whitespace when scanning for a macro's argument, so
# `\citep\n\n{key}` isn't valid LaTeX either; (2) _blank_code (below)
# replaces a fenced/verbatim block with spaces but preserves its
# newlines, and a fenced block is always >=2 lines -- so bare \s* could
# bridge clean across a blanked-out code block and merge two unrelated
# pieces of text into one fake "citation" (e.g. `\nocite` before a
# verbatim block plus an unrelated `{...}` group after it), a false
# positive that would push the PostToolUse hook to block on invented
# grounds. A single optional newline can never span a whole blanked
# block, so the bridge is closed while `\citep\n{key}` keeps working.

    Kept for src/review/citation_coverage.py (the remaining caller that only ever
    hands this one line at a time -- src/references.py was switched to
    call extract_citekeys() directly in this same change) and for the
    existing test suite, which exercises this shape extensively.

    This is NOT complete in two ways, both stemming from the same cause:
    a caller feeding one line at a time only ever hands this wrapper text
    that already had its newlines cut out by something like str.splitlines().
    - False positive: a fenced code block spanning multiple lines needs
      both its opening and closing ``` in the same string for _blank_code
      to recognize it, so an in-code @token on its own line can still read
      as a citation.
    - False negative: TeX allows whitespace -- including a newline --
      between a control word and its argument (\\citep\n{key} is valid,
      equivalent to \\citep{key}), but a command on one line and its
      {key} argument on the next arrive at this wrapper as two separate,
      independently-unmatchable calls; neither one contains the whole
      pattern. extract_citekeys(text) run on the whole document catches
      this (see test_whitespace_including_newline_between_command_and_brace)
      because the newline between them is still present in its input.
    citation_coverage.py (the only remaining per-line caller) is
    informational-only, never a gate, so both gaps are known and
    low-stakes rather than worth complicating this wrapper's contract to
    close. See extract_citekeys() for the whole-document scan that gets
    all of this right -- prefer it for any new caller that has the whole
