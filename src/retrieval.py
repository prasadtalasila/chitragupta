"""BM25-ranked keyword retrieval over the shared corpus layer.

This is the default retrieval implementation genre skills call against
(AGENTS.md's "Retrieval" section) -- stdlib-only, no venv or model
download needed. `src/enrich/embed_index.py` (sentence-transformers +
Chroma/Qdrant) is a verified, working embedding-based upgrade path with
a matching `search(query, k)` shape, ready to swap in without changing
callers once BM25 stops being enough for this corpus -- that's a
deliberate call to make when it comes up, not a threshold this module
should assert a number for. It is a *replacement*, not a complement:
nothing here fuses or re-ranks the two, and a caller uses one or the
other (docs/RETRIEVAL.md).

Two boundaries worth knowing, because they're easy to assume otherwise.
This module reads the ledger's `parsed_path` -- `content/parsed/*.txt` --
and never `content/docling/`, so running the enrichment layer's Docling
stage does not change what BM25 ranks or what its snippets say; only `[parser].backend`
does. And nothing in `src/enrich/__main__.py` imports this module, so
the enrichment layer neither uses nor updates this index.

Ranking is Okapi BM25 (stdlib-only: no rank_bm25 dependency), not raw
term-frequency -- term-frequency alone has no document-length
normalization, so a long document only needs to accumulate more raw
hits than a short one to outrank it, regardless of how small a
fraction of the long document those hits represent.

Scale: a naive implementation re-reads and re-tokenizes every
document's parsed text from disk on every call, which grows linearly
with corpus size and with each document's length. Term-frequency stats
per document are cached to disk (config.RETRIEVAL_INDEX_PATH), keyed by
a cheap per-item fingerprint (parsed-file stat -- exists/size/mtime, not
content), so a call only re-tokenizes documents whose text actually
changed since the last run -- mirroring src/ledger.py's own
stat-before-hash skip logic and src/enrich/embed_index.py's embedding
cache. Building a snippet for the returned top-k still reads those
(bounded, small) documents' text fresh, since a snippet needs the real
surrounding text, not just term counts.

# Zooming in on one document
# --------------------------

# `search` above answers "which documents, and roughly why", with a
# snippet long enough to judge a candidate on. `evidence` answers the
# question that comes after it for a document you have already decided is
# worth the attention: "what in *this* paper actually bears on my query?"
#
# It is a lookup, not a stage. Nothing has to call it, and a caller that
# is satisfied by a `search` snippet is done. That framing is deliberate
# and was arrived at the hard way -- an earlier version of this module
# made a short-window `triage` pass the mandatory first stage of drafting,
# with `evidence` reserved for whatever survived it. docs/REJECTION.md is
# the full reckoning; the short version is that it put an irreversible
# decision (rejecting a source, which `rejected.md` then makes permanent)
# on a third of the evidence, in exchange for a saving that was
# conditional, unmeasured, and real for one genre out of five.
#
# What survived that reckoning is here, because none of it needed the
# split: the window chooser `_windows` (now shared with `_snippet`, and
# the reason a snippet is deterministic at all), this CLI, `evidence`
# itself, and `--log`. Used this way `evidence` deepens an *acceptance*
# rather than cheapening a rejection, which is the safer direction: being
# more careful about a source you are about to cite cannot lose you one
