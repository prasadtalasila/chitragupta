"""Where a citekey's supporting text comes from, and whether it may be
quoted.

One ladder, tried best-first, for any consumer that needs to point at
*part* of a source rather than at the whole thing:

1. `content/docling/<citekey>.passages.json`, if the enrichment layer's
   Docling stage has run. Real reading-ordered paragraphs, semantically labelled.
2. `content/parsed/<citekey>.passages.json`, if the corpus layer parsed
   this citekey with `[parser].backend = "docling"`. Same records, from
   the same `passage_records()` below.
3. `content/parsed/<citekey>.txt` split on form feeds -- page-level only.
4. `pdftotext -layout` on the PDF the ledger recorded, same shape as (3),
   for a citekey parsed by a backend that left no page breaks.

Rungs 1 and 2 are the same data from two independent parses, and they are
separate files rather than one because the two layers own different
directories and run on their own schedules. The corpus layer must be able
to invalidate *its* sidecar on every re-parse -- including a switch back
to `pdftotext`, which leaves no passages at all -- without deleting an
enrichment sidecar it did not write and cannot reproduce. Rung 1 wins when
both exist: the enrichment stage parses the PDF a second time, under its
own OCR and figure settings, and is the richer of the two.

The difference between (1)/(2) and (3)/(4) is not cosmetic, and it is the
reason this module exists as its own seam. `pdftotext -layout` preserves
a page's *visual* arrangement rather than its reading order, so on a
two-column paper each output line splices together two unrelated columns
-- 82%-89% of long lines on 4 of the 10 papers measured in this project's
own sample. Bag-of-words *scoring* survives that, because splicing moves
words around within a page rather than between pages. *Quoting* does not:
an excerpt cut from that text is a collage of two arguments, which is
worse than no excerpt at all because it reads as evidence.

So the guarantee is structural rather than advisory: a page-level
`Passage` carries `text=None`, and a caller that wants to quote has
nothing to quote. `quotable` reports that fact; it does not gate a field
that is sitting there anyway.

`passage_records()` lives here rather than beside either writer for the
same reason the ladder does: this module is stdlib-only and is already
the sidecar's reader, so both producers -- `src/pdf_text.py` in the
corpus layer and `src/enrich/docling_parse.py` in the enrichment layer --
share one definition of what a passage is. It takes a Docling document by
duck-typing (`getattr` only, no import), which is what lets a module with
no venv dependency describe a document only a venv can build.

Extracted from src/review/citation_provenance.py, which owned this ladder when
it was the only consumer, and kept as its own seam for a second one that
has not been built yet: `src/retrieval.py` still cuts its snippets as a
character window straight out of `content/parsed/`. A snippet shown to a
drafting agent as evidence is under exactly the same constraint as a
passage shown to a reviewer, and the two should not answer "what does
this source say here?" from different text -- but today they do.

Stdlib only (sqlite3/re/subprocess), like citation_gate.py and
references.py -- runs with bare `python3`, no venv.
