"""The working state that produced a draft, kept on disk so a later
session can revise it without re-running the drafting pipeline.

`citation_gate`, `references`, `render_output` and `citation_provenance`
all operate statelessly on a draft *file*: hand any of them a draft from
last month and they work. The drafting layer is the only stateful part
of this pipeline, and until this module none of that state was written
down -- it lived in one chat session and died with it. So "shorten
section 3" cost a full re-run: retrieve, score every candidate again,
re-cluster, rewrite. This module is the missing half, and
docs/DRAFT-ITERATION.md is the argument for why it is shaped this way.

**One dossier per draft, mirroring the draft's own path.** A dossier
directory is `content/dossiers/` plus the draft's path relative to
`content/drafts/`, minus the suffix:

    content/drafts/dt-for-engineers/survey.md
    -> content/dossiers/dt-for-engineers/survey/

That rule is mechanical, needs no registry to map one to the other, and
handles both layouts this repo actually contains -- the flat
`content/drafts/<slug>.md` the genre skills describe, and the
`content/drafts/<topic>/<genre>.md` the shipped example content uses.

**Markdown, not JSON.** Everything a dossier holds is read by a model or
a human, both of which read Markdown natively; nothing here is a data
structure some other module consumes. Markdown also means a restored
tarball is legible on its own a year later, without this code.

**Several files, not one**, because a revision should load only what it
needs: the scope and the section map are small and always relevant, the
rejected-candidate list is the largest and is only needed when a change
opens a sub-theme up for re-searching, and `retrieval.md` is written by
the tooling and read by nobody until someone asks what a run cost.

Deliberately *not* a gate and not a lock-taker. Nothing here blocks a
draft, and nothing here writes to the corpus layer -- the ledger is only
ever opened read-only, and only to answer "has the corpus moved since
this draft was written?". A dossier that is missing, stale or
hand-edited degrades the next revision's efficiency; it can never make a
draft wrong.

That is why `status()` reports rather than raising: a missing ledger, a
missing draft, an unparsable fingerprint and a hand-edited file all come
back as something to print. The one thing its *CLI* treats as an error is
a dossier that does not exist at all -- `_cmd_status` exits 1 there,
because "there is nothing to report yet, run `init`" is an actionable
condition a script should be able to branch on, unlike "this dossier
exists and the corpus has moved".

`status --all` extends the same posture across every dossier at once:
which drafts cite a citekey the ledger has since lost, and which new
papers this draft's own recorded queries would have surfaced. It always
exits 0 -- drift is the normal state of a live corpus -- and, like
everything else here, it writes nothing: see `_ephemeral_index` for why
`src.retrieval.search()` cannot be used to do the matching.

Stdlib only (re/sqlite3/tarfile/hashlib), like citation_gate.py,
references.py and citation_provenance.py -- runs with bare `python3`, no
venv, on a machine where the corpus was never built.

Usage:
    python3 -m src.dossier init content/drafts/<name>.md --genre survey
    python3 -m src.dossier status content/drafts/<name>.md
    python3 -m src.dossier status --all [--json]
    python3 -m src.dossier sections content/drafts/<name>.md
    python3 -m src.dossier brief content/drafts/<name>.md --section "2. Failure modes"
    python3 -m src.dossier list
    python3 -m src.dossier export [<name> ...] [--out FILE] [--with-rendered]
    python3 -m src.dossier restore <archive.tar.gz> [--force]

# Both delimiters, because the dossier is written by hand and by two

# while a missed real key gets reported as "never considered" when it was
# cited. False positives are no longer entirely free, though: since the
# drift report, this same set is also differenced the other way to find
# citekeys that have *left* the ledger, where an invented one would be
# reported as a broken citation that isn't. The separator requirement is
# what holds that line -- `@someone` and `@2` do not match, only the

    """Append one retrieval call to the dossier's `retrieval.md`.

    Creates the file if the dossier exists but predates it, and creates
    the dossier directory if a skill logged before running `init` --
    losing a measurement because the skeleton wasn't there yet would be a
    silly way to fail, and this writes nothing a later `init` would
    clobber.

    The query is flattened onto one line before it is written. A pipe
    would split the row into extra cells and a newline would split it
    into two rows -- and `retrieval_cost` reads rows positionally, so
    either one turns a logged call into a silently miscounted one rather
    than a visible error. Whitespace is collapsed with `split()`, which
    covers newlines, tabs and carriage returns together.

    **Nothing here ever writes at an offset.** That matters because
    `--log` is a flag on the retrieval CLI and a skill dispatching
    parallel subagents could hand it to all of them, so two processes
    can reach this function at once. The file is opened once, in append
    mode, and the template is written only when that open finds it
    empty -- so both the template and the row go through `O_APPEND` and
    land at whatever the end of the file is *at the time of the write*.
    A writer can therefore never overwrite what another one put there.

    Two earlier shapes could, and both are worth naming because each
    looks correct:

    - `if not path.exists(): path.write_text(TEMPLATE)` truncates, and
      the check goes stale between the two calls.
    - Creating with mode `"x"` fixes that, but publishes an empty file
      and then writes the template to it from offset 0. A second writer
      that appends a row in between has it overwritten.

    What this does *not* promise: that the template is written exactly
    once. Two writers that both find the file empty both write one, so
    the file can carry a duplicate header. That is deliberately the
    failure left in, because it loses nothing -- `retrieval_cost` skips
    any row whose last cell isn't an integer, which both the header and
    its separator are -- and `_count`'s advisory total is one high.
    Buying exactly-once would need a lock or a link-into-place dance,
    for a file whose whole point is to be cheap. See the module
    docstring, and docs/TOKENS.md for why a lock is the wrong instrument
    here.

    Write atomicity is deliberately *not* claimed. Both writes go
    through one buffered handle and may well reach the filesystem as a
    single small write -- but that is an implementation detail of how
    the template's size compares to a buffer, not behaviour to rely on:
    buffered text I/O can flush at points of its own choosing, closing
    may still issue more than one write, and POSIX does not promise that
    a write to a regular file arrives unsplit. Nothing here depends on
    any of that. `retrieval_cost` skips
    any row it cannot parse, so a torn row costs that one measurement
    and leaves every other row intact -- while a row overwritten at an
    offset would have been silently gone. The guarantee this function
    makes is the weaker, sufficient one: no writer addresses a position,
    so no writer can destroy what another wrote.

# spends it once per subagent. Handing over a command instead moves the
# same text into the subagent's own one-shot context, where it is billed
# once and discarded with that context.

# carrying: a context is append-only between compactions, so material
# already returned into it stays. What it removes is the re-emission --
# and, because the dossier outlives the run, the need to re-derive any of
