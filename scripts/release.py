"""Builds a distributable release/chitragupta-<version>.zip.

Version comes from pyproject.toml's [tool.poetry].version -- the single
source of truth for it (see that file's own comments on why Poetry here
is a lockfile/venv manager only, not a publishing mechanism; this script
doesn't change that, it just reads the version Poetry itself considers
current).

Bundles every git-tracked file (`git ls-files`, so .gitignore's exclusions
-- content/parsed/, papers/bibliography.bib, .venv-full/, etc. -- are
already handled) except:

- this repo's own machinery, which does something only in a git checkout
  of it: tests/, bench/ (parser wall-clock measurement against *this*
  host's own bib corpus, which a release consumer doesn't have), and
  .github/ + .gitignore (CI config, git config and issue/PR templates).

  **Every prose document ships** -- README.md, docs/, SOUL.md, AGENTS.md,
  DEVELOPER-AGENTS.md and DEVELOPER.md -- as does `.claude/` and its genre
  skills. Those skills cite AGENTS.md by name for the citekey invariant,
  and the docs cross-reference each other freely, so excluding any one of
  them leaves dangling references in the rest. Someone who unzips a
  release to work on the pipeline needs the developer docs as much as
  someone who cloned it.
- content/ and papers/, which do have a handful of git-tracked files
  despite mostly being gitignored (e.g. content/drafts/*.md example
  drafts) -- per-host example/personal data that shouldn't ship as
  someone else's example in a fresh release. Shipped as empty placeholder
  directories instead of omitted outright, so config.toml's default paths
  (content.dir, bib.path's parent) still resolve to something that exists
  before a first `sync` run populates them.

Stdlib only (tomllib, zipfile, shutil) -- runs with bare `python3`, no
venv, same as citation_gate.py/references.py. Needs `git` on PATH to list
tracked files; nothing else.
