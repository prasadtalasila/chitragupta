"""chitragupta/runlock.py: one writer at a time across content/.

Deliberately a sqlite file used purely as a mutex, not an O_EXCL lock
file and not the ledger itself. The experiment behind that choice, run
against real sqlite before any of this was written:

  - a connection holding BEGIN IMMEDIATE does NOT block other processes
    from READING, so citation_gate and the drafting skills keep working
    during a sync (a RESERVED lock permits readers);
  - a second process attempting BEGIN IMMEDIATE gets SQLITE_BUSY, so it
    works as a mutex;
  - after kill -9 on the holder the lock is released immediately, so
    stale locks self-heal with no PID liveness check -- which is the
    part an O_EXCL lock file cannot do portably;
  - a bare BEGIN IMMEDIATE with no write still holds it.

The ledger itself is not used, because chitragupta/ledger.py commits at five
separate points: wrapping a run in one transaction would trade
incremental durability for the mutex.
