""".claude/hooks/citation_gate_hook.py: the PostToolUse hook that
mechanically enforces AGENTS.md's citation gate on every Write/Edit under
content/drafts/ (PR #5). This has zero repo-tracked tests of its own --
its three behavioral fixes (path resolution against the hook's own fixed
location rather than cwd, is_relative_to containment instead of substring
matching, and a malformed-stdin guard) were previously only verified with
ad-hoc pipe-tests during that PR's review cycle.

The hook derives repo_root from its own on-disk location
(Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent.parent), not from
config.CONTENT_DIR -- so content/drafts/ can't be redirected via
isolated_config the way the rest of this test suite redirects paths;
tests that need a real gated file create one under this actual repo's
(gitignored) content/drafts/ and clean it up afterward. The hook's own
subprocess.run call for `python -m src.citation_gate` doesn't pass
env=, so it inherits whatever env this test process hands to the hook
subprocess -- used here to point the citation_gate child process at an
isolated ledger via CONTENT_DIR instead of this repo's real one.
