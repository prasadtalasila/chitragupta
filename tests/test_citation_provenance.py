"""chitragupta/review/citation_provenance.py: what in a cited source supports the claim
citing it.

The interesting cases here are the ones a synthetic fixture makes easy to
get wrong: hard-wrapped prose (every draft this project writes), and a
claim that scores against nothing.

Where the passages themselves come from -- sidecar, form-feed pages, or
`pdftotext` -- is tests/test_passages.py's, since chitragupta/passages.py owns
that ladder. What stays here is what this module still decides: which
sentence carries a citation, how it scores, and how the report reads.
