"""scripts/release.py: builds release/chitragupta-<version>.zip
from git-tracked files, excluding developer-only material. Uses a real,
throwaway git repo (cheap, and exercises the actual `git ls-files` call
rather than mocking subprocess) rather than the real repo's own tracked
files, so exclusions/inclusions are asserted against a small, controlled
fixture instead of this project's ever-changing file list."""
