"""Build the benchmark's work lists from this host's own bib corpus.

Writes three files, all gitignored because all three are per-host data
(they carry absolute PDF paths, and `papers/bibliography.bib` itself is
gitignored for the same reason -- see AGENTS.md):

  bench/corpus.json      every resolvable PDF, with its page count
  bench/sample16.json    16 PDFs drawn at even page-rank intervals
  bench/sample_small.json  the 6 smallest of those

The samples are drawn by *rank*, not at random and not by hand, so the
sample's page distribution mirrors the corpus's -- including the tail,
which matters here: one 675-page document is 5% of all pages in this
corpus, and a sample that happens to exclude it understates the total by
more than any other single choice in this harness.

Run this before bench/bench_docling.py. Needs the "enrich" Poetry group
(pypdfium2 arrives with docling).
