"""Turn measured per-PDF Docling timings into a whole-corpus wall-clock estimate.

**Both models below understate a real run. This is measured, not
suspected**, and it matters because a figure from this tool was quoted as
fact across the documentation for two releases.

On 2026-08-04 a real serial `python -m chitragupta.corpus sync` over the 501-PDF corpus
(OCR off) took **3330s / 55m 30s**. From the same 16-PDF sample this tool
predicted:

  per-doc     50m 32s   -- 9% low
  per-page    39m 11s   -- 41% low   <- the number the docs quoted

So: **read the per-doc figure, treat it as a floor, and prefer a real
measurement whenever you can afford one** (bench/sweep_sync.py runs the
actual pipeline). The two models:

  per-doc    for each corpus PDF, predict from a linear fit
             seconds ~= a + b*pages, then sum. The intercept `a` is real
             -- a 1-page PDF does not cost 1/17th of a 17-page one -- so
             this is the model to read.

  per-page   total_pages * (measured seconds / measured pages).
             Assumes cost is strictly proportional to pages, which drops
             the intercept entirely. Reported only as an optimistic bound.

Why both are still low: a sample of 16 documents parsed back-to-back in
one warm process pays no per-document process overhead, no ledger
bookkeeping, and no scheduling gaps -- all of which a 501-document run
does. The sample is drawn evenly by page rank (bench/sample16.json), so
the page mix is right; it is the surrounding work that is missing.
