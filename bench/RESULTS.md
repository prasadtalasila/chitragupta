# Measured: what a full Docling parse of the bib corpus costs

A dated record, oldest first. Host throughout: 4x NVIDIA A40 46GB, driver
555.42.02, CUDA 12.5, 96 logical CPUs of which this container is allowed
48 (`Cpus_allowed_list: 0-23,48-71`). docling 2.117.0, torch 2.7.1+cu126.

Raw per-run data is in `results/<date>-<tag>/`. Reproduce with the
commands in [README.md](README.md).

## Which sections are current

**Read this before quoting a number.** Nothing here is deleted when a
later run overturns it -- being able to see which conclusions were wrong,
and what corrected them, is the point of the directory (see
[PARALLELISM-PLAN.md](PARALLELISM-PLAN.md)'s method). But that only works
if it is obvious which is which, so:

contract is

## The corpus

`papers/bibliography.bib` has 646 entries; 501 resolve to a PDF on disk
(94 `non_pdf_attachment`, 50 `no_file_field`, 1 `pdf_path_gone`).

| | |
|---|---|
| PDFs to parse | 501 |
| Total pages | 13,400 |
| Total bytes | 1.54 GB |
| Pages: median / mean | 16 / 26.7 |
| Pages: p90 / p95 / max | 39 / 63 / 675 |

A single 675-page document is 5% of all pages. Any scheduling that picks
it up last is bounded below by that one document.

## Wall clock

Sample: 16 PDFs at even page-rank intervals (943 pages), so the sample's
page mix mirrors the corpus's.

| Configuration | s/page | Full-corpus estimate |
|---|---|---|
| 1 process, 1 A40 | 0.43 | **1h 36m** (per-page), 1h 56m (per-doc fit) |
| 1 process, CPU only | 1.37 | 5h 05m (per-page), 5h 21m (per-doc fit) |

> **Superseded 2026-08-04.** These are *extrapolations from a 16-PDF
> sample*, and both models understate a real run. Measured directly, a
> serial full-corpus pass with OCR **on** takes 6941.4s (1h 56m) -- which
> the per-doc fit got right and the per-page model missed by 21%. With
> OCR **off** the measured figure is 3330.4s (55m 30s) against a per-page
> prediction of ~39m: **41% low**. See
> ["2026-08-04: the full-corpus sweep"](#2026-08-04-the-full-corpus-sweep).

Per-PDF cost ranged 0.11-1.52 s/page, so read those as a band of roughly
1.5-2 hours on GPU, not a point estimate.

## The GPU is not the bottleneck

Sampled with `nvidia-smi dmon` during the serial run, and confirmed
against a CPU-only run of the same PDFs:

- **GPU SM utilisation averaged ~7%** -- mostly 0%, spiking to 47%.
- **VRAM: 1.7 GB of 46 GB** (3.6%).
- **The process sat at ~300% CPU** -- 3 of the 48 allowed logical CPUs.
- **Like-for-like GPU vs CPU on the same 6 PDFs: 32.0s vs 57.4s = 1.79x.**

One Docling process leaves ~93% of one A40 idle and touches 6% of the
available CPU; three of the four GPUs are never addressed at all. The
work is CPU-bound -- PDF backend, layout post-processing, and OCR (which
runs on onnxruntime, on the CPU) -- with short GPU bursts for the layout
and table models.

That 1.79x is the entire benefit the GPU currently delivers, and it is
why this work pursued CPU-level parallelism first and GPU assignment
second.

## Three code facts behind the numbers

1. **`src/sync.py`'s parse loop is serial** -- a plain
   `for ref in references:`. Its own comment names `ProcessPoolExecutor`
   as the deferred candidate and pre-commits to the right shape (ledger
   writes stay on the main thread). The reasons it gives for deferring
   hold for the `pdftotext` default and for routine incremental syncs;
   they do not hold for a bulk Docling run.

2. **`src/pdf_text.py:_extract_docling` builds `DocumentConverter()`
   inside the function** -- once per PDF. `initialized_pipelines` is an
   instance attribute, so every document re-initialises the models.
   Measured cold start for the first converter: **16.5s**.
   `src/enrich/docling_parse.py` calls `_build_converter()` inside
   `parse_doc`, with the same effect.

3. **`AcceleratorDevice.AUTO` resolves to `cuda:0`, always**
   (`decide_device("auto") == "cuda:0"`, verified directly). A bare
   `DocumentConverter()` does use a GPU with no configuration -- but
   every process that starts picks *the same* GPU. Using all four A40s
   requires explicit device assignment; it will not happen on its own.

A fourth fact, host-specific but a live trap for worker sizing:

4. **`os.cpu_count()` reports 96 here; only 48 are allowed.** Pool sizing
   must use `len(os.sched_getaffinity(0))`. Sizing off `cpu_count()`
   would oversubscribe 2x. This already bit the benchmark run: a
   `taskset -c 24-39` invocation failed outright with `Invalid argument`.

## 2026-08-02: parallel `sync`, and the ceiling it hit

Measured 2026-08-02 with the real `python -m src.sync`, not the bench
harness: 60 bib PDFs (1,166 pages), `parser.backend = "docling"`, OCR off,
via `[parser].workers`.

| workers | wall clock | speedup | efficiency |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 444.4s | 1.00x | -- |
| 4 | 123.4s | **3.60x** | 90% |
| 12 | 120.3s | 3.69x | 31% |

Four workers scale almost linearly. Twelve buy essentially nothing over
four, and `nvidia-smi dmon` during that run says exactly why:

```
# gpu    sm%          <- GPU 0 pinned at 100%, GPUs 1-3 idle throughout
    0    100
    1      0
    2      0
    3      0
```

**The bottleneck has moved.** Before this work the parse was CPU-bound
and one A40 idled at ~7%. Enough CPU parallelism to saturate that GPU
turns the same workload into a *single-GPU-bound* one -- while the other
three A40s are never addressed at all, because Docling's
`AcceleratorDevice.AUTO` resolves to `cuda:0` in every worker process
(fact 3 above).

That is the argument that produced per-worker GPU assignment: the four
GPUs stopped being redundant the moment document parallelism landed. A 60-document sample already saturates one card at 12
workers, so the full 501-document corpus will too.

On smaller batches the per-worker model load dominates instead: over 8
documents, 4 workers gave 1.90x and 8 workers gave none (34.6s / 18.3s /
19.3s). Each worker pays its own cold start, so parallelism is worth
having in proportion to how much work there is -- which is why the
resolved worker count is capped by the number of documents needing a
parse.

Correctness was checked, not assumed: `content/parsed/` after a 4-worker
run is byte-identical to the serial run's, and the ledger rows match.

## 2026-08-02: OCR costs more than the GPU saves

Measured 2026-08-02 on the same 16-PDF sample and the same GPU, with
`bench_docling.py --no-ocr`. Raw timings:
`results/2026-08-02-phase0/gpu_reused_noocr.jsonl`.

| | s/page | Full corpus |
|---|---|---|
| OCR on (Docling's default) | 0.431 | ~1h 36m |
| OCR off | 0.176 | **~39m** |

**2.46x**, from one setting -- more than the 1.79x the GPU is worth.

> **Superseded 2026-08-04.** 2.46x is a *serial 16-PDF sample* figure.
> Measured end to end on the full corpus, OCR costs **2.08x serially but
> 3.91x at 12 workers and 4.79x at 24** -- it is CPU-bound, so it
> competes with the parallelism. Quoting 2.46x for a parallel run
> understates it by roughly half.
Docling's OCR runs on the CPU (RapidOCR on onnxruntime), which is a large
part of why this pipeline is CPU-bound.

### It is not free, and the cost is easy to miss

Turning OCR off changed the extracted text of **8 of the 16** documents.
That is the number to design around, not the speedup.

OCR only runs on *bitmap* regions, so what it recovers is text that
exists in the PDF as an image rather than as characters. Diffing the two
outputs, that breaks down as:

- **Publisher furniture** -- `IEEEAccess`, `DTU Library`, logos. Noise;
  losing it is an improvement.
- **Figure sub-captions** -- e.g. "(a) The system context physical block
  diagram models the boundary of the system...". Borderline.
- **Real content, on a minority of documents.** `afrin_resource_2021`
  lost **10.1%** of its characters: two complete tables, a
  three-column comparison matrix and an abbreviations list, both embedded
  as images. `perno_implementation_2022` lost a paragraph of body prose
  set in a graphical text box.

So the default is `ocr = false` (2.46x on this serial sample -- 2.08x to
4.79x measured end to end depending on worker count, see below), but it
is a trade-off rather than a free win, and the
parse-quality guard will not catch a bad choice -- it looks for
run-together words, not for content that never arrived. A corpus of scans
needs `ocr = true`; so does one where tables-as-images matter more than
parse time.

## 2026-08-02: the converter rebuild

`DocumentConverter` cold start is **16.5s** on this host, and
`initialized_pipelines` is an instance attribute -- so the pre-0.12.0
`src/pdf_text.py`, which built one converter per PDF, paid a model reload
for every document in the corpus. Both `pdf_text.py` and
`enrich/docling_parse.py` now build one converter and reuse it, and
`parse_corpus` defers the build until a document actually needs parsing,
so a fully-cached re-run loads no models at all.

## 2026-08-02: spreading workers across the four A40s

Measured 2026-08-02 with the real `python -m src.sync` over the **whole
501-PDF corpus** (13,400 pages), `docling`, OCR off, 12 workers. The A/B
is the same binary either way -- `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0` confines every
worker to one card, which is exactly the pre-v1.1.0 behaviour, since
`AcceleratorDevice.AUTO` resolves to `cuda:0` in every process.

| | wall clock |
|---|---|
| 12 workers, one A40 (`AUTO`, i.e. before this change) | 528.0s |
| 12 workers, four A40s (round-robin) | **326.2s** |
| Speedup from using the other three cards | **1.62x** |

Against the ~39-minute serial baseline, the full corpus now parses in
**5m26s -- about 7x**.

### Corpus size decides whether this is worth anything

The same change measured on a 60-document subset showed **nothing**:
122.4s at 4 workers, 123.0s at 12, with all four GPUs busy and the CPU
~85% idle. Per-worker startup -- spawn, importing torch and docling, then
loading the models -- dominates at that size, and no amount of GPU
spreading helps. It only pays once there is enough work to amortise
twelve workers' startup, which the full corpus has and a 60-document
sample does not.

This is also why the earlier reading of the 12-worker plateau as
"GPU 0 is the bottleneck" was too simple. GPU 0 *was* pinned at 100%, but
freeing it did not speed up the 60-document run at all -- the plateau
there was startup, not contention. Both effects are real; they show up at
different scales.

### Output is not bit-reproducible under concurrency

Comparing the one-GPU and four-GPU runs over all 501 documents: **6 files
differ**, by 0 to 59 bytes out of ~100KB each (under 0.06%).

The differences are not device-dependent -- parsing the same document
explicitly on `cuda:0`, `cuda:1` and `cuda:2` gives byte-identical output
every time, and repeating a run at the same worker count reproduces
exactly. What varies is Docling's element grouping inside **dense
reference blocks** under heavy concurrency: the same words, split across
list elements or lines differently.

Nothing is lost, and retrieval tokenises on runs of `[a-z0-9]` rather
than on element or line boundaries, so this does not affect BM25 ranking.
(It does affect the passage sidecar, which was not measured until
[2026-08-07](#2026-08-07-does-the-quotable-passage-survive-a-re-parse).)

**Can it be turned off?** Not from Docling. Its `PdfPipelineOptions` has
no determinism, seed or reproducibility setting of any kind (checked
against 2.117.0's full field list), and `AcceleratorOptions` exposes only
`device`, `num_threads` and `cuda_use_flash_attention2`. The only lever
is below Docling, in torch: `torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True)`
plus `cudnn.deterministic`, set inside each worker. That is not taken
here, for two reasons -- it costs throughput on exactly the models this
pipeline spends its time in, and it raises rather than degrades when an
op has no deterministic implementation, which would turn a cosmetic
difference into a hard failure. Revisit if bit-reproducible parses ever
become a requirement rather than a nicety.

It does mean `content/parsed/` should not be expected to be
byte-identical across runs at high worker counts -- v1.0.0's
"byte-identical to serial" observation was measured over 8 documents at 4
workers, where it holds, and does not generalise to 501 documents at 12.

## Per-worker startup: where the ~10s goes, and how much of it is shareable

Measured 2026-08-03 on the same host. The question this section answers
is the one the 60-document plateau above raised: workers were spending
about ten seconds each before producing anything, so what *is* that ten
seconds, and can a different multiprocessing start method share any of
it?

### The breakdown

One cold process, timed at each stage, parsing a small PDF twice (docling
2.117.0, OCR off, `cuda:0`, warm HuggingFace cache):

| Stage | Time |
|---|---|
| `import torch` | 1.16s |
| `import docling` (the 4 modules the converter needs) | 2.08s |
| `DocumentConverter(...)` construction | 0.13s |
| First `convert()` -- Docling loads its models here | 5.17s |
| **Total before the first parsed page** | **8.5s** |
| Second `convert()` of the same PDF, models warm | 0.33s |

So of the ~8.5s: **3.2s is importing Python modules and ~5.0s is loading
models.** Only the first is even a candidate for sharing between
processes -- `initialized_pipelines` lives on the converter instance, in
whichever process built it.

Two things that looked like they might be in that 5s, and are not:

- **CUDA context creation is almost none of it.** The same first
  `convert()` on `device="cpu"` takes 6.32s of which 2.24s is the parse
  itself, i.e. ~4.1s of model load; on `cuda:1` it is 5.24s of which
  0.42s is the parse, i.e. ~4.8s. The GPU adds ~0.7s over the CPU-side
  work of reading weights and building modules.
- **HuggingFace hub lookups are not it either.** `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`
  changed the first convert by 0.24s.

### Does `torch.cuda.device_count()` initialise CUDA in the parent?

**No -- and the code comment that said it did was wrong.** That claim was
the stated reason `sync` used `spawn`. Checked directly against torch
2.7.1: after `torch.cuda.device_count()` returns 4,
`torch.cuda.is_initialized()` is still `False`, and a child forked from
that parent allocates on `cuda:0` without complaint. torch routes device
counting through NVML precisely to keep that safe. Only *using* a device
in the parent breaks the child, and then it breaks loudly:

```
RuntimeError: Cannot re-initialize CUDA in forked subprocess.
```

`gpu_count()` now asks `nvidia-smi --list-gpus` instead, falling back to
torch only when the driver's own tool isn't on PATH. That is not because
the torch path was unsafe on this host -- it wasn't -- but because it
made safety depend on an implementation detail of one torch version, and
because it imported 1.2s and ~200MB of torch into a parent with no other
use for it. `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` has to be applied by hand on that
path: nvidia-smi ignores it, and torch does not.

### fork is still ruled out, for a different reason

Not CUDA -- sqlite. By the time `sync` builds its pool it holds two live
sqlite connections: the run lock (`BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, deliberately never
committed) and the ledger. SQLite's own documentation says not to carry
an open connection across `fork()`, and a forked worker finalising an
inherited connection on its way out would be rolling back a transaction
belonging to a process it is not.

Measurement removed the temptation anyway. Wall clock for N processes to
each build a converter and parse one PDF, charging any parent-side
prewarm to the total:

| Workers | spawn | fork | fork, parent pre-imports | forkserver | forkserver + preload |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | 11.26s | 9.68s | 9.70s | 10.39s | **9.55s** |
| 12 | 13.96s | 13.25s | 13.00s | 13.41s | **12.61s** |

forkserver with a preload list is the fastest at both sizes *and* is the
only one that inherits nothing from the parent -- its server is a fresh
interpreter, launched with `spawnv_passfds`, so workers get the preloaded
modules and no sqlite connections, no CUDA context, no file descriptors.

### The result that decided the design: a shared import is a wash

The obvious reading of the breakdown is "3.2s x N workers, shared once by
forkserver". That reading is wrong, and the real `sync` says so:

| 8 documents, 4 workers | median of 3 |
|---|---|
| spawn | 22.9s |
| forkserver, preload set at pool construction | 22.4s |

Workers import **concurrently**. On a host with CPUs to spare their
imports were already overlapped, so what forkserver takes out of N
children it puts back into the one parent that runs the preload -- and
the preload blocks pool construction. Net: nothing.

What *is* serial is the preload itself. Started before the parent reads
the bibliography rather than when the pool is built, it runs during the
~2.5s that read takes:

| | 4 live workers ready at |
|---|---|
| forkserver started when the pool is built | 6.90s |
| forkserver started before the bib read | **4.40s** |

`multiprocessing.forkserver.ensure_running()` returns in ~0.02s -- it
launches the server and does not wait for its imports -- so this costs
the caller nothing but the ordering.

### End to end, on the real `sync`

Medians of three runs each, fresh `content/` every time so every document
needs a parse. Rank-stratified subsets of the bib corpus, `docling`, OCR
off, on the four-A40 host. `workers = 1` takes the serial path, which has
no pool and therefore no start method.

| Documents | Workers | spawn | forkserver | Saving |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | 1 (serial) | 46.2s | -- | -- |
| 8 | 4 | 23.1s | **21.8s** | 1.3s (5.6%) |
| 8 | 8 | 22.9s | **20.7s** | 2.2s (9.6%) |
| 60 | 1 (serial) | 383.2s | -- | -- |
| 60 | 4 | 103.6s | **101.9s** | 1.7s (1.6%) |
| 60 | 12 | 80.8s | **78.8s** | 2.0s (2.5%) |

Run-to-run spread was 0.3-1.0s, so the effect clears the noise at every
point, and it is the *same* effect at every point: a roughly constant
1.3-2.2s off pool startup. What changes with corpus size is only how much
of the total that is -- 9.6% of an 8-document run, 2.5% of a 60-document
one, and it would be well under 1% of the full 501-PDF corpus.

**So this does not make a bulk parse meaningfully faster, and it was
never going to.** The startup breakdown said so before any of these runs:
3.2s per worker, shared once, against a parse measured in minutes. What
it does help is the case the earlier measurements kept running into --
a handful of documents, where startup *is* the run.

Correctness was checked rather than assumed: over 8 documents at 4
workers, `content/parsed/` is byte-identical between the two start
methods and the ledger rows match. Ctrl+C behaviour is unchanged --
exit 130, no orphaned processes, and the same
`resource_tracker: ... leaked semaphore` warning that `spawn` already
produced (a consequence of `os._exit` skipping interpreter shutdown, not
of the start method).


## 2026-08-04: the full-corpus sweep

Measured with the real `python -m src.sync` over **all 501 PDFs** rather
than a sample, on the same machine (4x A40, 48 CPUs available of 96 host
logical CPUs), repository at `92c1420` (v2.1.0). Every run started from
an empty `CONTENT_DIR` and reported 501 parsed, 0 failed. Raw records:
`results/2026-08-04-full-corpus/sweep.jsonl` -- **wall clock only.** The
CPU-busy and GPU-utilisation figures quoted below came from separate
instrumented runs on the same machine and are *not* in that file; the
resource sampler was added to `sweep_sync.py` afterwards, so
`results/2026-08-04b-repeats/sweep.jsonl` is the first record set
carrying them. Treat the timings here as reproducible from the committed
data and the utilisation figures as reported, not evidenced.

Reproduce with `bench/sweep_sync.py`, which was written for exactly this
and did not exist when the earlier sections were measured.

### It corrected the baseline, which corrected everything downstream

| | |
|---|---|
| Serial, OCR off -- **measured** | **3330.4s (55m 30s)** |
| Serial, OCR off -- per-page extrapolation (what the docs quoted) | ~39m, **41% low** |
| Serial, OCR off -- per-doc fit | ~50m 32s, 9% low |

One wrong denominator propagated into every efficiency figure in this
repository. `bench/estimate.py` now leads with the per-doc model and says
plainly that both understate.

### Worker scaling

| Workers | Wall clock | Speedup | Efficiency | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3330.4s | 1.00x | -- | |
| 4 | 799.2s | 4.17x | 104% | |
| 8 | 428.6s | 7.77x | 97% | |
| 12 | 310.2s | 10.74x | 89% | the most `worker_ceiling()` allows |
| 16 | 268.1s | 12.42x | 78% | |
| 24 | 237.6s | 14.02x | 58% | |
| **32** | **220.7s** | **15.09x** | 47% | single run; see 2026-08-04b |
| 48 | 226.3s | 14.72x | 31% | single run; see 2026-08-04b |

**The clamp is costing 1.41x.** `worker_ceiling()` caps at
`allowed_cpus // 4 = 12`; the optimum is near 32. Rows above 12 required
relaxing that constant and are not reachable with a stock checkout.

`[parser].workers = 16` resolves to 12 and takes 315.9s -- the clamp
working as documented.

### The `_CPUS_PER_DOCLING_WORKER = 4` model is wrong

CPU busy during these runs, against the 48 available:

| Run | CPUs busy | of the 48 allowed |
|---|---|---|
| 16 workers | 18.7 | 39% |
| 32 workers | 34.0 | 71% |
| 24 workers, OCR on | 44.6 | **93%** |

At 32 workers the CPU is still only 71% busy. The constant came from a
single "~300% CPU" observation of one process; the optimum implies a
divisor near **1.5**.

Confirmed independently: docling's own `num_threads` barely matters.

| threads (at 12 workers) | 1 | 2 | 4 (default) | 8 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| wall clock | 305.3s | 304.3s | 310.2s | 305.6s |

**1.9% spread -- noise.** The hypothesis that `12 workers x 4 threads`
oversubscribes 48 CPUs is disproved, and it explains why more workers
help: the threads a worker is charged for are not doing much.

### GPUs

| Workers | 1 GPU | 2 GPUs | 4 GPUs | 1->2 | 2->4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 12 | 518.4s | 339.7s | 310.2s | 1.53x | 1.10x |
| 24 | 535.8s | 298.6s | 237.6s | **1.79x** | 1.26x |

The second card is worth far more than the third and fourth, and matters
more at higher worker counts. At 24 workers, one GPU is *slower* than at
12 -- piling workers onto a single card is counterproductive.

These agree with the 2026-08-02 phase 2 figures (528.0s / 326.2s) to
within 2-5% on a rebuilt venv, which is the cross-check that the parallel
measurements were sound and only the *baseline* was wrong.

### OCR

| Workers | OCR off | OCR on | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3330.4s | 6941.4s | 2.08x |
| 12 | 310.2s | 1213.9s | 3.91x |
| 24 | 237.6s | 1139.0s | **4.79x** |

Speedup from 1 to 24 workers: **14.02x with OCR off, 6.09x with it on.**
OCR roughly halves how well the pipeline parallelises.

### Open, not glossed

- **The OCR optimum was not found** -- swept only to 24 workers, where it
  was still improving.
- **One machine, one corpus.** Any specific replacement divisor may not
  generalise, particularly to a CPU-only machine where the GPU is doing
  none of the work.

Two questions this section used to list were answered on 2026-08-04b,
below.

## 2026-08-04b: repeats, and where the time goes

The single-run sweep above left two questions. Three runs per point, with
`sweep_sync.py` timing each run's phases, settled both. Raw records:
`results/2026-08-04b-repeats/sweep.jsonl`.

| Workers | Runs (s) | Median | Spread |
|---|---|---|---|
| 24 | 234.6, 235.0, 235.8 | 235.0s | 1.2s |
| 32 | 222.8, 223.4, 309.6 | 223.4s | **86.8s** |
| 48 | 220.4, 221.4, 227.7 | 221.4s | 7.3s |

### The 32 -> 48 "reversal" was noise

Medians put 32 and 48 **0.9% apart** — while the spread *within* the
32-worker configuration alone is 86.8s. The single-run pass had 32 at
220.7s and 48 at 226.3s and read that as a knee; with repeats the
ordering flips.

**The curve plateaus past ~32; it does not turn back up.** Single runs
cannot resolve anything in that region, which is the argument for
`--repeat`.

### What flattens the curve: startup, plus the CPU filling up

Timing each run's phases separates the three candidates:

| Workers | Startup (to 1st document) | Tail (after last) | CPU busy |
|---|---|---|---|
| 24 | 18.6s — **7.9%** | 4.9s — 2.1% | 56% |
| 32 | 21.8s — **8.9%** | 5.9s — 2.6% | 70% |
| 48 | 28.5s — **12.7%** | 7.9s — 3.6% | 78% |

- **Startup is a growing tax, not a fixed one.** Every worker pays its
  own ~8.5s model load, so the cost of standing the pool up rises with
  the pool: 7.9% of the run at 24 workers, 12.7% at 48.
- **Startup is measured as time to the first completion**, so it
  includes the fastest document's parse and overstates pure startup. Its
  growth across worker counts does not: a single parse does not slow down
  because the pool got bigger.
- **The CPU is heading for saturation** — 56% to 78% host-wide across the same
  range. Earlier the 71% figure at 32 workers was read as "the CPU is not
  the limit"; against 56% at 24 and 78% at 48 it is clearly *becoming*
  one.
- **The long-document tail is not the story**: 5-8s throughout, under 4%.

Neither cost alone explains the plateau. Together they account for it,
and both worsen with every worker added — which is why past ~32 there is
nothing left to win by adding more.

## 2026-08-07: does the *quotable passage* survive a re-parse?

Measured with `bench/repro_check.py` on the same host as the sections
above, but with **48 CPUs pinned via `taskset -c 0-23,48-71`** to match
the `Cpus_allowed_list` those sections ran under -- the container now
permits 96, which would move `worker_ceiling()` from 12 to 24 and change
`docling_threads()` underneath the comparison. Workers held at 12
throughout; GPU count is the only varied axis, 1 against 4, the same pair
that produced ["Output is not bit-reproducible under
concurrency"](#output-is-not-bit-reproducible-under-concurrency) above.
Raw records: `results/2026-08-07-passage-repro/*.json`.

### The question that section left open

That finding compared `content/parsed/<citekey>.txt` and concluded the
differences were cosmetic, on the grounds that retrieval tokenises on
whitespace. True for BM25 -- but `src/passages.py` writes **one passage
record per `dl_doc.texts` item**, and `PASSAGE_LABELS` contains
`list_item`, the element type that finding names. So the same variance
could be changing the exact span this pipeline would quote to a reviewer,
which is not cosmetic on a citation-grounding tool. Nobody had looked.

### What was run

Page-count outliers (Tukey, `Q3 + 1.5*IQR` = 49 pages) were excluded from
the n=50 and n=100 samples, then measured *separately* as their own arm:
they are the documents with the largest reference lists, so excluding
them without checking would have let the exclusion decide the result.

Each pair is compared at three levels -- file bytes, passage *spans*
(text, label, page) and passage *texts* alone -- because they do not
agree, and only the last one is a changed quotation.

| Arm | Docs | Pages | across `.txt` | across spans | across **texts** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| n=50 trimmed | 50 | 848 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| n=100 trimmed | 100 | 1683 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| n=100 trimmed (independent repeat) | 100 | 1683 | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| outliers only | 36 | 5590 | 1 | 1 | **0** |

**Across-config, over 286 document comparisons: 4 differ in bytes
(1.4%), 4 in passage spans (1.4%), and 3 in passage *text* (1.0%).**
Consistent with the 6-of-501 (1.2%) above, so this replicates the
phenomenon rather than contradicting it. Both populations show it:
trimming was safe here, but only because the outlier arm was run.

The gap between spans and texts is the whole reason for measuring both.
Every difference in the outliers arm is a label or bounding-box change on
byte-identical text -- real instability in Docling's classification, but
**not** a changed quotation. Reporting the spans number as though it were
the text number would have overstated the finding by a third.

An earlier session on 2026-08-07, before the texts level existed, saw
6/286 bytes and 5/286 spans -- roughly twice this session's byte rate.
Two independent sessions differing about twofold at a ~1-2% base rate is
what a low-rate stochastic effect looks like, and is the same caveat as
["Power, stated plainly"](#power-stated-plainly) below. Only this
session's records are committed, because the earlier ones predate the
spans/texts split and cannot answer the question the table now asks.

### Correction: same-configuration runs do **not** reproduce exactly

The section above states that "repeating a run at the same worker count
reproduces exactly". That is false, and this is the measurement that
falsifies it: **5 of 572 same-configuration document-comparisons differ
in bytes (0.9%), 4 in passage spans (0.7%), and 2 in passage text
(0.3%)**. Every instance was at 4 GPUs; the single-GPU arm was clean in
all four samples, over 286 comparisons. A same-configuration run
therefore changes a quotable passage about once in every 300 documents --
rarer than the across-config case, and not zero.

So the axis is contention, not the *change* in contention -- a
multi-GPU run disagrees with itself. Across-config is still ~4x more
likely on text (1.0% vs 0.3%), so widening the concurrency delta does
raise the rate; it does not create the effect.

### Three mechanisms, and only one of them matters

Inspecting the kept bytes (`--keep`) separates cases that a byte-diff
would have reported identically. The excerpts below were captured from a
kept parse in the earlier session; **the committed records reproduce all
four documents independently, in the same three classes** -- which is
checkable without the bytes, since each record names the differing
citekeys at each of the three levels:

| Document | Mechanism | In the records |
|---|---|---|
| `frasheri_addressing_2023` | reference entry splits | in `texts_differ` |
| `noauthor_compilation_nodate` | two entries merge | in `texts_differ` |
| `delhibabu_synthesis_2023` | label flip, text identical | in `spans_differ`, **not** `texts_differ` |
| `zhang_digital-triplet_2024` | table regroups | in `txt_differ` only |

A fifth, `noauthor_mqtt_2018`, appeared in this session's outliers arm as
another label-only flip -- the same class, a document the earlier session
did not surface, which is what a ~1% rate over a small sample looks like.

**1. A reference entry splits or merges -- the quotation changes.** In
`frasheri_addressing_2023`, between two runs of an *identical*
configuration, one 279-character record became two:

```
- 'M. Grieves, J. Vickers, Digital twin: ... Transdisciplinary Perspectives on Co'   (279c)
+ 'M. Grieves, J. Vickers, Digital twin: ... Transdisciplinary Perspectives on Co'   (223c)
+ 'International Publishing Switzerland, 2017, pp. 85-113.'                           (55c)
```

Quoting the second version returns a reference truncated before its
publisher and page range. In `noauthor_compilation_nodate` the reverse
happened -- two records merged into one, splicing reference numbers 57
and 60 into a single passage. **This is the failure mode that matters:**
the text of a quotable passage genuinely differs between runs.

**2. A label flips inside `PASSAGE_LABELS` -- harmless, but only by
luck.** `delhibabu_synthesis_2023` kept all 540 records and identical
text; one line was classified `list_item` in the 1-GPU run and `text` in
the 4-GPU run. Both are in `PASSAGE_LABELS`, so the passage survives. A
flip *out* of that set -- to `footnote`, `caption`, `page_header` --
would delete a quotable passage outright. What makes this instance benign
is the membership of the set, not the flip.

**3. A table regroups -- the `.txt` moves, the sidecar does not.**
`zhang_digital-triplet_2024` differed in its markdown table's cell
wrapping across runs while its 184 passage records stayed byte-identical
in both text and label, because tables are not in `PASSAGE_LABELS`. This
is the one case where the older "cosmetic" reading is exactly right.

### What this means for the contract

`content/parsed/<citekey>.passages.json` is **not** reproducible under
docling, and not merely across configurations -- a multi-GPU run
disagrees with itself on the *text* of a passage at roughly 0.3% of
documents, and with a differently-configured run at roughly 1.0% (1.4%
if a label change counts). Neither `--reparse` nor a fresh clone is
guaranteed to reproduce a previously quoted span.

Unchanged by this: `pdftotext` output is byte-identical across runs, and
the ledger rows are stable except `last_synced`. See
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full artifact
table this feeds.

### Power, stated plainly

286 across-config comparisons at a ~1% rate is enough to establish that
the effect exists and reaches the passage layer. It is **not** enough to
put a tight interval on the rate, and a 0-of-50 arm is fully consistent
with a 2% rate rather than evidence of stability. The three mechanisms
are each observed once or twice; treat them as existence proofs of
distinct failure modes, not as a frequency distribution over them.

## 2026-08-08: what a drift sweep costs

`python3 -m src.dossier status --all` builds a BM25 index in memory and
throws it away, rather than calling `src.retrieval.search()` -- which
would take a write connection to the ledger and rewrite
`content/retrieval_index.json` on every scan
([docs/DRAFT-ITERATION.md](../docs/DRAFT-ITERATION.md#why-the-new-papers-are-not-found-with-search)).
That design was argued from the shape of the code and shipped with an
unmeasured claim attached: that a warm cache makes the scan nearly free
and a cold one costs one corpus tokenization *shared across every
dossier*. This is the stopwatch.

Host: the multi-GPU machine (48 allowed CPUs, 251 GB RAM), bare
`python3` 3.12.3, no GPU involved -- `src.dossier` is stdlib-only, so
this needs no venv. Medians of 5 runs.

### The real corpus: 646 ledger rows, 47.4 MB of parsed text

`bench/bench_drift.py --real` copies this host's own
`content/ledger.sqlite` and tokenizes the real `content/parsed/*.txt`
behind it. The ledger is copied rather than opened in place because the
warm step calls the real `retrieval.search()`, which goes through
`ledger.connect()` -- a write connection that runs migrations. Timing a
scan against someone's corpus is fine; migrating it is not. Verified
byte-identical after the run.

4 logged queries per dossier:

| Dossiers swept | Cold (no index cache) | Warm (cache from a prior `search()`) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2.032s | 0.218s |
| 10 | 2.036s | 0.257s |
| 50 | 2.227s | 0.436s |

**The claim holds, and this is the line that shows it.** Going from 1
dossier to 50 costs **+0.19s cold** -- about 4ms per additional dossier
against a 2.0s fixed cost. The tokenization is paid once for the sweep,
not once per dossier; had it been per-dossier, 50 dossiers would have
taken somewhere near 100s.

A warm cache is **5.1-9.3x** faster than a cold one, so "nearly free"
was fair for the warm case and optimistic for the cold one: 2.1s is not
free, it is just cheap enough to run after every sync.

Dossiers that logged no retrieval calls never build an index at all:
**0.040s for 50 dossiers**, which is the pure file-reading floor.

### Run-to-run spread, and why the marginal cost is still safe to quote

Three independent runs of the same configuration:

| | run 1 | run 2 | run 3 (the one above) | spread |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| cold, 1 dossier | 2.130s | 2.126s | 2.032s | 4.8% |
| cold, 50 dossiers | 2.364s | 2.368s | 2.227s | 6.4% |
| warm, 1 dossier | 0.218s | 0.221s | 0.218s | 1.4% |
| **paired delta, 1 -> 50 cold** | **+0.234s** | **+0.242s** | **+0.194s** | |

An earlier edition of this section quoted "about 0.5%" from the first two
runs and called the marginal cost "comfortably outside the noise". The
third run makes the first half of that wrong: cold time varies by
**~5-6%** between runs, which is ~0.1-0.14s -- the same order as the
0.19-0.24s delta being measured. Warm time is far steadier (1.4%),
because it is not dominated by re-reading and re-tokenizing 47 MB.

The conclusion survives, but only because of *how* the delta is measured.
The 1-vs-50 comparison is **paired**: both numbers come from the same
process, the same page-cache state and the same machine conditions,
seconds apart. All three runs independently produce a positive delta in a
narrow band (0.194-0.242s), which is the evidence -- not a subtraction
across separately-scheduled runs, which the 5% drift would swallow.

Quote the marginal cost from a single run's paired pair. Do not compute
it by differencing numbers from two different runs of this table.

### Synthetic corpora, as a scaling cross-check

`bench_drift.py` without `--real` generates a corpus of the same shape
(501 documents, median 16 pages at ~500 words, one 675-page book, Zipfian
vocabulary). Kept because it is the only way to vary corpus size, and
worth reading as a check on the generator: at a comparable document
count it lands within ~30% of the real corpus, which is close enough to
trust its *scaling* and not close enough to quote its absolute seconds.

| Corpus | Documents | Parsed text | Cold, 1 dossier | Cold, 50 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| real | 646 | 47.4 MB | 2.032s | 2.227s |
| synthetic | 501 | 38.1 MB | 1.521s | 1.685s |
| synthetic | 2000 | 148.6 MB | 5.857s | 6.471s |

4.0x the documents costs 3.9x the cold time (1.521s -> 5.857s), so the
tokenization is linear in corpus size, as expected -- it reads every
parsed file once. The per-dossier marginal cost stays flat at every
size: +0.61s for 49 more dossiers at 2000 documents, ~12ms each.

### What this does not measure

- **A cold page cache.** Every run here re-read 38-149 MB that the OS
  had cached; the first sweep after a reboot pays disk for it too.
- **Another corpus's vocabulary.** One real corpus, on one topic. A
  corpus with a much larger vocabulary changes the index size, though not
  the shape of the result.
- **`--json`.** Serialization is a rounding error against tokenization
  and was not separated out.
- **Concurrency.** The scan is single-threaded and was measured on an
  otherwise-idle machine.

Reproduce:

```bash
python3 bench/bench_drift.py --dossiers 1 10 50 --repeats 5 \
    --out bench/results/<date>-drift/drift-501.json
```

## 2026-08-10: `overlap` and `scan` -- what the fingerprint index (#110) and the whole-draft scan (#111) actually buy

Both features shipped on an architectural argument (content-addressed
caching, a corpus-wide index) rather than a stopwatch. This measures both
against a real draft and this project's own real corpus, rather than the
tiny synthetic fixtures the unit test suite uses.

Host: the multi-GPU machine (48 allowed CPUs, 251 GB RAM), bare `python3`
3.13.5, no GPU involved -- `src.overlap_index` and `scripts/verbatim_check.py`
are stdlib-only. Corpus: this project's own `content/ledger.sqlite`, 497
parsed items. Draft: `bench/fixtures/cloud-computing-for-digital-twins.md`,
a genuine ~3,000-word chapter written for this measurement, citing 16 real
corpus papers.

### #110: the per-document fingerprint cache

`scripts/verbatim_check.py overlap` used to re-invoke `pdftotext -layout`
on the cited PDF and rebuild its n-gram dictionary from scratch on every
call. Measured against the 16 citekeys the draft actually cites, before
(commit 18f9f4b2, the parent of #110's merge) and after:

| | 16x `overlap` |
|---|---|
| before #110 (pdftotext subprocess, every call) | 2.379s |
| after #110, cold (.fpr cache built this run) | 0.477s (**5.0x**) |
| after #110, warm (.fpr cache from a prior run) | 0.081-0.087s (**27-29x**) |

The "before" figure is a one-time historical comparison, not something
`bench/bench_overlap.py` reproduces going forward -- the pre-#110
implementation no longer exists on `main`. Reproduce it by checking out
18f9f4b2 and timing `cmd_overlap` from `scripts/verbatim_check.py` there.

### #111: N invocations of `overlap` versus one `scan`

Before #111, the only way to approximate a whole-draft check was running
`overlap` once per citekey the draft cites -- and even that only ever
compares a paragraph against the one source it names. `scan` slides the
whole draft across the whole corpus index in one call, no citekey
argument.

`bench/bench_overlap.py --draft bench/fixtures/cloud-computing-for-digital-twins.md`,
against the real corpus, `CONTENT_DIR` pointed at this host's own
`content/`:

| | time |
|---|---|
| 16x `overlap` (warm .fpr caches, i.e. #110 already paid for) | 0.087s |
| 1x `scan`, cold corpus index (first `build_corpus_index()` ever, this host) | 27.2-27.5s |
| 1x `scan`, warm corpus index (unchanged corpus, second call) | 0.214-0.216s |

Read as a wall-clock number alone, this looks like a regression: 0.087s
for the thing #110 already made fast, versus 27s the first time anyone
runs `scan` on an unchanged 497-document corpus. That first cost is the
one-time price of merging every fingerprintable document's postings --
per-document fingerprinting is itself cached (`fingerprint_document`), so
a *second* corpus-wide build, even after every existing `overlap` call
has already populated the per-document `.fpr` cache, still pays the
merge-and-sort over ~millions of postings once. After that one-time
build, `scan` is 0.21s regardless of how many citekeys the draft cites --
the real comparison the "N invocations" framing invites is N *scan*-scale
checks against N separate `overlap` calls, and `scan` checks every
source in the corpus, not just N of them, in less time than 3 warm
`overlap` calls take.

**The number that matters is not the wall clock.** It's what each mode
can structurally see. `bench/fixtures/cloud-computing-for-digital-twins-planted-reuse.md`
is the same chapter with one added paragraph, verbatim from a real,
uncited corpus paper (`aguzzi_cloud_2020`, never mentioned anywhere else
in the draft):

```
16x overlap (one per cited source): surfaces the planted reuse? False
1x scan: surfaces the planted reuse? True
  [18 words, pdf p.1] aguzzi_cloud_2020 (tier=exact) [UNCITED SOURCE]
  [10 words, pdf p.2] aguzzi_cloud_2020 (tier=exact) [UNCITED SOURCE]
```

This is not a near-miss `overlap` could catch with a longer run or a
lower `--n` -- it is structural. `cmd_overlap(draft, citekey)` only ever
loads *that* `citekey`'s own fingerprint (`grams_for_citekey`); a source
never named in the 16 citekeys a reviewer would think to check is never
loaded at all, no matter how many times `overlap` is run. `scan` finds it
in the same 0.21s warm call as everything else, because it checks every
parsed source in the corpus against every word of the draft, not just the
sources the draft happens to cite.

### What this does not measure

- **A corpus larger than 497 documents.** The one-time `scan` build cost
  is expected to grow roughly linearly with corpus size (more documents
  to fingerprint and merge), matching `bench_drift.py`'s finding for the
  retrieval index's own cold cost -- not verified here.
- **`--gap`'s cost.** The gap-tolerant run merge is a constant-factor
  addition per diagonal group; not separated out from the rest of `scan`'s
  per-call cost.
- **Concurrency.** Both modes are single-threaded, measured on an
  otherwise-idle machine.
- **A cold page cache.** `content/ledger.sqlite` and 497 parsed text files
  were already OS-cached from prior runs on this host.

Reproduce:

```bash
CONTENT_DIR=/path/to/your/content python3 bench/bench_overlap.py \
    --draft bench/fixtures/cloud-computing-for-digital-twins.md \
    --out bench/results/<date>-overlap/overlap.json
```
