"""Does the same corpus, parsed twice, produce the same *quotable passages*?

`bench/RESULTS.md` already answers a narrower question: at high worker
counts a handful of `content/parsed/<citekey>.txt` files come back with
dense reference blocks grouped into elements slightly differently -- 6 of
501, under 0.06% of a file. That was filed as cosmetic, and for BM25 it
is: retrieval tokenises on whitespace, so regrouping the same words
changes no ranking.

It is not obviously cosmetic one layer down. `src/passages.py`'s
`passage_records()` writes **one record per `dl_doc.texts` item**, and
`PASSAGE_LABELS` includes `list_item` -- the very element type that
finding names. If Docling splits a reference block across list elements
differently, the sidecar does not merely shift bytes: the *set of
passages* changes, and with it the exact span this pipeline would quote
to a reviewer. On a tool whose whole purpose is grounded citation, "the
passage we would quote can differ between runs" is a different claim from
"6 files differ by 59 bytes", and nobody has measured which one is true.

That is what this script measures, and why it is separate from
`sweep_sync.py`: that harness answers "what does a configuration cost"
and throws its output away, while this one answers "is the output the
same" and must keep every byte to compare.

## What it varies, and what it holds still

The variance is not device-dependent -- parsing one document explicitly
on three different cards gives byte-identical output every time -- so the
knob is contention, and the comparison that produced the original finding
was one-GPU against four-GPU at a fixed worker count. This reproduces
that shape: `--workers` is fixed, `--gpus` varies, and `--cpus` pins the
affinity mask so the CPU budget cannot drift between arms (which would
change `worker_ceiling()` and `docling_threads()` underneath the
comparison).

Every configuration is also run `--repeat` times, and that control turned
out to matter more than it was meant to. `bench/RESULTS.md` states that
"repeating a run at the same worker count reproduces exactly"; **this
harness falsified that** on its first hundred-document sample, where two
runs of one identical configuration -- same 12 workers, same 4 cards,
same pinned CPU mask -- disagreed on one document. So `--repeat 1` is not
enough to interpret anything: without the same-config arm, that
difference would have been silently attributed to the GPU count.

## Three levels of difference, deliberately not conflated

A sidecar carries a `bbox` of four floats straight from Docling's
provenance. Float wobble can byte-differ a file whose passages are
identical, so reporting bytes alone would overstate the finding this
script exists to check. Each pair is therefore compared at three levels,
narrowing from "any byte" to "the thing a reviewer would be shown":

  bytes   -- the raw fact: is the file identical?
  spans   -- is the ordered list of (text, label, page) records
             identical? Ignores bbox, so float wobble in coordinates
             nothing reads yet cannot masquerade as instability.
  texts   -- the load-bearing fact: is the ordered list of passage
             *texts* identical? This is what would actually be quoted.

`spans` and `texts` are kept apart because a real run separated them.
Docling classified one identical 124-character line as `list_item` in a
one-GPU run and `text` in a four-GPU run: `spans` differs, `texts` does
not. Both labels are in `PASSAGE_LABELS`, so the passage survives either
way and nothing quotable changed -- reporting that as a changed quotation
would be an overstatement.

It is not nothing, though, and the reason is worth stating: a label that
flipped *out* of `PASSAGE_LABELS` (to `footnote`, `caption`,
`page_header`) would delete a quotable passage outright. A label flip is
therefore evidence that the classification is unstable, and only the
membership of `PASSAGE_LABELS` decides whether a given flip is harmless.

A document whose `.txt` differs while its texts do not is a real result,
and the opposite of the one hypothesised above -- it would mean the
markdown variance does not reach the quotable text. Both outcomes are
worth having; only conflating them is worthless.

## The sample, and why outliers come out

`--sample N` draws N documents from `bench/corpus.json` (run
`make_corpus.py` first) using the same rank sampling as the rest of
`bench/`, so the subset's page distribution mirrors the corpus's rather
than being picked by hand.

Page-count outliers are excluded first, by Tukey's rule -- above
`Q3 + 1.5*IQR`. On this corpus that fence sits at 49 pages and removes 36
of 497 documents (7.2%) which between them hold **42% of all pages**,
including one 675-page book that alone is 5% of the corpus and took 246s
on its own in the 2026-08-02 baseline.

Excluding them is right for *this* question and would be wrong for a
throughput benchmark, which is why it is a flag and not a default
buried elsewhere. A reproducibility check counts documents, not pages: a
single book cannot be more or less reproducible than a paper, but it can
double the wall clock of every arm and set a floor no amount of
parallelism gets under -- which buys no statistical power at all. Pass
`--keep-outliers` to measure the corpus as it actually is.

## Usage

    python bench/make_corpus.py                 # writes bench/corpus.json
    python bench/repro_check.py --sample 50 \\
        --workers 12 --gpus 1,4 --repeat 2 --cpus 0-23,48-71 --tag n50

Each run starts from an empty CONTENT_DIR, so it also gets its own
`pipeline.lock.db` and cannot contend with -- or block -- a real `sync`
on the same host.
