name: survey-writer
description: Drafts a topic-clustered literature survey / background section / "state of the art" from the synced corpus, with a comparison table and a gap analysis. Every claim is grounded in a citekey pulled from content/ledger.sqlite via src.retrieval -- never a fabricated one. Triggers when the user asks to write or draft a survey paper, literature review, background section, or related-work section for a given topic. To change or update a survey that already exists in content/drafts/, use draft-reviser instead -- never re-run this skill to make a change. Must run `python -m src.citation_gate` on its own output and only present the draft once it passes. Refuses (and tells the user to run `python -m src.sync` first) if the ledger is empty.

# survey-writer

Genre-specific drafting agent for survey-style output. This is the "generative
drafting" half of the pipeline (the drafting layer) -- it runs on demand and its
output is reviewed by the user, unlike `python -m src.sync` (the corpus
layer: deterministic, safe to run unattended).

## Shared corpus layer (read, don't regenerate)

- `content/ledger.sqlite` -- per-citekey status, populated by `sync`
- `papers/bibliography.bib` (gitignored, per-host) -- the source of truth for citekeys/metadata;
  `sync` reads it, it is never regenerated
- `content/parsed/<citekey>.txt` -- extracted PDF text
- `src/retrieval.py` -- `python3 -m src.retrieval search "<q>" --k 15`, which
  returns a citekey, title, score and a 500-character snippet per candidate.
  `... evidence "<q>" --citekey <key>` reads more of one document when a
  snippet is not enough to judge it

## The dossier: write down what produced the draft

The draft is only half of what this run produces. The other half is the
judgment behind it -- the reader, the scope, the glossary, which
candidates were kept and **which were turned down and why** -- and it
belongs on disk, not in this conversation. Without it the next revision
has to re-retrieve and re-score the whole topic to change one paragraph.

`src/dossier.py` owns that state, in Markdown, one directory per draft at
`content/dossiers/<the draft's path, minus its suffix>/`. Create it before
you search (step 0) and fill it in as you go -- not at the end, when what
you rejected has already fallen out of your context. `docs/DRAFT-ITERATION.md`
is the full design.

**Read-only means read-only: never run `python -m src.sync`, and never
run `scripts/enrich.py` or any `src/enrich/*` stage.** Both belong to the
corpus layer, both take the pipeline's write lock, and either can run for
tens of minutes -- a first full-corpus parse, or building the embedding
index. They are the user's to run, not yours. If a semantic index would
help and none exists, say so and use `src.retrieval.search()`; do not
build one.

**If the ledger is empty, stop.** Check before drafting anything:

```bash
python3 -m src.ledger
```

If it reports no items, or none with status `parsed`, say so plainly --
name what you checked and what you found -- and stop there. Do not draft
around it, do not sync, do not cite. Tell the user to run
`.venv-full/bin/python -m src.sync` and come back.

## When to invoke

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| User asks for a survey / lit review / background / related-work section on topic X | Invoke this skill |
| User asks for a thesis chapter | Use `thesis-chapter-writer` instead |
| User asks for a textbook chapter / lecture notes / worked examples | Use `textbook-chapter-writer` instead |
| User asks for a hands-on tutorial the reader follows at a keyboard | Use `tutorial-writer` instead |
| User asks to change a survey that **already exists** in `content/drafts/` | Use `draft-reviser` instead -- never re-run this skill to make a change |
| Ledger is empty, or nothing is `parsed` | Say so and stop. **Never** run `src.sync` yourself |

## Prose standards

Follow `docs/WRITING-STANDARDS.md` for the cross-genre rules: name the reader
before drafting, define terms once, state scope up front, active voice with a
named actor, ban "obviously/simply/just", and reread as the reader before
presenting. That file also carries the attribution for where these
principles come from -- Diátaxis, Last's *Technical Writing Essentials*, and
Google's Technical Writing courses, all CC-licensed and all requiring credit.
The genre-specific additions below layer on top of it.

### What a survey owes its reader

A survey's job is to **organize a field and locate the gaps in it** -- not to
teach the topic and not to advocate a position. Two failure directions:

- **Drifting into a textbook chapter.** You start explaining the concepts for
  a reader who doesn't know them. A survey's reader is a researcher entering
  the area; they need the map, not the lesson. If the user actually wants the
  lesson, `textbook-chapter-writer` exists -- say so.
- **Drifting into an argument.** You start defending one approach as correct.
  Weighing alternatives is the deliverable here; picking a winner is the
  thesis chapter's job, and doing it in a survey hides the disagreement the
  reader came for.

Unlike the tutorial genre, **alternatives and options are the point**. Never
collapse them for the sake of a cleaner narrative.

## Process

0. **Name the reader and the scope, and open the dossier.** Before
   searching, settle who this survey is for (a thesis reader? a grant
   reviewer? a paper's related-work section?) and what it will and won't
   cover. Write the scope statement into the draft's opening paragraph --
   including what's deliberately excluded, so a reader can tell an
   omission from an oversight. Then create the dossier and record the same
   decisions there:
   ```
   python3 -m src.dossier init content/drafts/<slug>.md --genre survey
   ```
   Fill in `scope.md`'s **Reader**, **Covers**, **Does not cover** and
   **Glossary** now, while you are deciding them. `init` also stamps the
   corpus fingerprint, which is what lets a later revision tell whether
   the ledger has moved since.
1. **Retrieve broadly, over-fetching on purpose.** Break the requested topic
   into 2-4 sub-themes if it's broad. For each:
   ```
   python3 -m src.retrieval search "<sub-theme>" --k 15 --log content/drafts/<slug>.md
   ```
   Pull more candidates than you expect to use. This is a keyword-overlap
   ranker, not embeddings (unless `src/enrich/embed_index.py` has been built
   for this corpus) -- a high score means the query's words are in the
   document, not that it supports your claim.

   `--log` records the call's size in the dossier's `retrieval.md`, which is
   what makes the cost of a run measurable instead of estimated. Pass it on
   every call.
2. **Score every candidate yourself before it counts as evidence.** Read the
   full snippet -- 500 characters, sized so you have enough to judge and not
   just a title -- and decide: does this actually support a claim about the
   sub-theme, or did it just share vocabulary with the query? Keep only the
   ones that pass. This is the discipline PaperQA2 calls "gather evidence"
   (retrieve, then judge relevance, *then* write); the difference here is you
   judge inline rather than via a second API call.

   Where a snippet is not enough to decide on a source you are minded to
   keep, read more of that one document:
   ```
   python3 -m src.retrieval evidence "<sub-theme>" --citekey <key> --log content/drafts/<slug>.md
   ```
   Use it to be **more careful about something you are about to cite** -- not
   as a routine second pass over everything. `docs/REJECTION.md` explains why
   the reverse, a cheap screen used to reject faster, was tried and withdrawn:
   a wrong rejection is invisible, unrecoverable, and then entrenched in
   `rejected.md`, which later revisions are told to trust.

   **Record both outcomes in the dossier before you start drafting prose**,
   while the passages are still in front of you:
   - what survives, into `evidence.md` -- one `## \`citekey\`` block with
     a `relevance:` line (why it supports the claim) and a `support:` line
     (the quote or paraphrase);
   - what doesn't, into `rejected.md` -- one table row per candidate:
     citekey, the query that surfaced it, and a few words on why it was
     turned down ("shares vocabulary only", "wrong domain", "superseded by
     X").

   The rejected list is the more valuable of the two and the easier to
   skip. It is what stops the next revision retrieving and re-judging the
   same twelve papers you just turned down -- the single most expensive
   piece of repeated work in this pipeline.
2a. **On a broad topic, put steps 1-2 behind a subagent.** Dispatch one
   `general-purpose` subagent per sub-theme, all in one message, each told to
   run the retrieve-and-score loop above and return **only** the kept-evidence
   packet plus the rejected list -- never the raw candidates.

   The reason is not parallelism. This is where the reliable token saving is:
   it costs nothing in retrieval quality, unlike trimming what you read.
   Anything you read yourself stays in
   your context and is re-sent on every later turn of the run; anything a
   subagent reads is paid for once. Four sub-themes retrieved inline is tens
   of thousands of characters you will then carry through clustering,
   drafting, gating and rendering, most of it material you already rejected.

   Skip this for a narrow topic with one sub-theme -- a subagent that returns
   almost everything it read saves nothing and costs a dispatch.
3. **Reformulate and re-search if a sub-theme comes up thin.** A single
   query wording is not the ceiling -- if scoring leaves you with little or
   nothing for a sub-theme, try synonyms, broader/narrower terms, or an
   adjacent concept, and search again. Do this a few times before concluding
   "thin coverage" is real rather than a wording problem. Only after genuine
   reformulation attempts should you report a sub-theme as thin -- and then
   say so explicitly rather than padding it with uncited claims.
4. **Cluster by judgment.** With a small corpus there's no BERTopic step;
   group the surviving (scored, kept) citekeys into themes yourself based on
   what the evidence actually says.
5. **Check for disagreement across sources before writing.** If two kept
   pieces of evidence conflict on a claim, don't silently pick one side --
   note the disagreement explicitly in the draft (which source says what).
   Silently resolving a real contradiction is a worse failure than leaving
   it visible.
6. **Draft**, in Markdown, using Pandoc-style citations (`[@citekey]`,
   `[@key1; @key2]`), citing only from your scored-evidence file:
   - Framing paragraph for the overall topic
   - One subsection per theme, citing the papers that actually support each claim
   - A comparison table: columns for approach/paper, citekey, core idea,
     stated limitations
   - A gap-analysis paragraph: what the retrieved corpus does *not* cover
     (including sub-themes that stayed thin after reformulation, and any
     cross-source disagreement from step 5)
7. **Never write a citekey you didn't get from a retrieval result.** If you
   want to cite something you know about from general knowledge but that isn't
   in the ledger, say so in prose to the user instead ("X is commonly discussed
   in this area but isn't in your synced library yet") -- do not invent a key
   for it.
8. **Map sections to citekeys.** Fill in the dossier's `sections.md` --
   one row per section heading with the citekeys cited under it -- so a
   later revision can tell which section owns a citation without reading
   the draft. `python3 -m src.dossier sections content/drafts/<slug>.md`
   prints the headings and their line ranges to build it from.
9. **Gate before presenting.** Save the draft as `content/drafts/<slug>.md`
   (this is the canonical, source-of-truth format), then run:
   ```
   python -m src.citation_gate content/drafts/<slug>.md
   ```
   If it reports `FAIL`, fix the offending line(s) — either correct the citekey
   or remove the claim — and re-run until it reports `OK`. Never show the user
   a draft that hasn't passed.
10. **Build the References section.** Once the gate passes, generate it from
    exactly the gated citekeys rather than writing it by hand:
    ```
    python -m src.references content/drafts/<slug>.md
    ```
    Stdlib-only, like the citation gate — bare `python3`, no venv. Writes
    numbered IEEE-style entries (`[1] J. Doe and R. Roe, "A Paper," *IEEE
    Trans. Testing*, vol. 3, pp. 1–9, 2024. \`doe_paper_2024\``) from
    `content/ledger.sqlite`, ordered by first appearance so the numbers
    match the rendered PDF's. Each entry keeps its citekey in a trailing
    code span, so a reader can trace every `[@citekey]` marker in the body
    back to an entry by that same key.

    Leave the body's inline citations as `[@citekey]` — do **not**
    hand-number them to `[1]`. The literal key is what the gate and the
    hook verify; pandoc assigns the numbers at render time.
11. **Render tex and pdf.** Once the gate passes and the references section
    is built, also render the other three formats:
    ```
    python3 -m src.render_output content/drafts/<slug>.md --format tex
    python3 -m src.render_output content/drafts/<slug>.md --format pdf
    python3 -m src.render_output content/drafts/<slug>.md --format md
    ```
    The `md` output is a numbered copy in `content/rendered/` -- the same
    IEEE numbers as the PDF, for a reader who won't open one. The draft
    itself keeps its `[@citekey]` markers.

    This needs only bare `python3` plus `pandoc`/`pdflatex` on PATH — no
    enrich group required. If either command reports `[missing-binary]` or
    `[error]`, print a one-line warning in chat with that message and
    continue anyway — a rendering failure never blocks presenting the
    `.md` draft.
12. **Read it once as the reader** (`docs/WRITING-STANDARDS.md` §6). Check
    specifically for: terms used before they're defined, a theme heading that
    doesn't match what the subsection actually argues, a comparison-table row
    that repeats prose already above it, and any paragraph whose first
    sentence doesn't carry its point.
13. **Record any steering.** If the user shaped this draft in chat --
    "don't lead with tooling", "shorter", "drop the adoption angle" --
    append it to the dossier's `steering.md`, dated. It is invisible in
    the prose and has nowhere else to live; a revision that doesn't know
    about it will undo it.
14. Present the draft plus a one-paragraph summary of thin-coverage areas and
    any unresolved cross-source disagreement, and report the render outcome
    (paths to the `.tex`/`.pdf` if they succeeded, or the warning if not).
    Tell the user where the dossier is, that changes to this draft should
    go through `draft-reviser` rather than another run of this skill, and
    that `content/drafts/` and `content/dossiers/` are gitignored -- so
    `python3 -m src.dossier export <slug>` is how a draft and its working
    state get backed up.

  survey is read by skimming.

  would destroy a survey. Only the underlying insight transfers -- that a
  document trying to do two jobs does both badly.
