"""PostToolUse hook: enforce the citekey gate on genre-skill drafts.

AGENTS.md calls python -m src.citation_gate "a gate, not a lint
suggestion" and every genre skill's prose instructs the agent to run it
before presenting a draft -- but until this hook existed, nothing
mechanically enforced that instruction; an agent could just skip the
step. This makes it enforced by the harness: every Write/Edit under
content/drafts/ (.md from survey-writer/textbook-chapter-writer/
tutorial-writer/deep-research,
.tex from thesis-chapter-writer -- see each SKILL.md's "Save the
draft/fragment as content/drafts/<slug>.{md,tex}" step) is gated
automatically, and a failure is surfaced back to Claude as blocking
feedback (not a silent/advisory warning).

Reads the PostToolUse JSON payload on stdin (schema: {"tool_input":
{"file_path": "..."}, ...}). Claude Code's own Write/Edit tools document
file_path as always absolute, and this hook has been proven live against
that -- but a substring match on "/content/drafts/" would silently skip
gating if a payload ever carried a relative "content/drafts/<slug>.md"
instead (no leading slash to match). Repo root is derived from this
script's own fixed location (<repo_root>/.claude/hooks/) rather than from
the target path, so a relative file_path is resolved against it instead
of just being ignored, and containment is checked via resolved path
parts (is_relative_to), not string matching.

Malformed stdin fails open (return 0, no block) rather than crashing:
invalid JSON syntax, valid JSON that isn't an object (e.g. a bare
array), and a "tool_input" that isn't itself an object are all treated
as "no file_path given" -- any of them previously reached a bare
`.get()` call on something that isn't a dict and crashed with an
uncaught AttributeError instead.
